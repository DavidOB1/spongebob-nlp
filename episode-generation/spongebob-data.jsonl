{"prompt": "Help Wanted", "completion": "The series premiere starts under the sea, as the French Narrator introduces Bikini Bottom and SpongeBob SquarePants.\nThe scene then shifts to SpongeBob in bed before his alarm clock goes off waking him up. He gets ready for the day; it is the day that he is to apply for a job at the Krusty Krab as a fry cook. Before going to the restaurant, he lifts a weight with stuffed animals on the sides to warm himself up for the application. SpongeBob starts jogging to the Krusty Krab, while Patrick Star encourages him from his rock.\nSpongeBob starts talking about what he is going to do when he reaches the Krusty Krab, but in the end, he decides he is not ready. However, Patrick appears and stops him, encouraging him that he was born to have the job. SpongeBob eventually decides to go to the Krusty Krab to get the job. Squidward Tentacles then sees SpongeBob running to the restaurant, making him panic and tell Mr. Krabs to watch out for SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob has already arrived, though, and he tries to get Mr. Krabs to give him the job, after jumping back and fourth across the restaurant after stepping on a loose nail. He tells Mr. Krabs that Squidward will vouch for him, but Squidward tells Mr. Krabs that he does not believe SpongeBob should get the job. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that if he gets a seemingly nonexistent hydro-dynamic spatula, he will get the job. SpongeBob quickly runs to the Barg'N-Mart to get it, as Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh, thinking he will not get it.\nSoon after SpongeBob leaves, five buses filled with anchovies arrive at the restaurant, making Squidward and Mr. Krabs panic, as the latter knows what happens when anchovies come. As the anchovies flood the restaurant, Squidward tries to get them settled, but that only angers them more. It seems as though the two are finished due to the flood of anchovies, but SpongeBob comes right on time with the hydrodynamic spatula he found (as there was only one in stock), having fulfilled the errand Mr. Krabs gave him. SpongeBob goes into the kitchen and cooks many Krabby Patties, and tosses them to all the hungry anchovies until they are all satisfied and leave the restaurant.\nMr. Krabs decides to recruit SpongeBob as a fry cook, much to Squidward's chagrin, because SpongeBob brought him a lot of money. Then, Patrick walks into the restaurant and orders, prompting SpongeBob to create a slew of Krabby Patties and chuck them all at him, flinging him out and ending the episode shortly after."}
{"prompt": "Reef Blower", "completion": "The episode begins with Squidward going outside, only to spot a shell on his lawn. He kicks the shell onto SpongeBob's yard to keep his own clean, but it turns out SpongeBob is also very protective of his lawn, and gets out a reef blower from his garage to get rid of it, the noise of the machinery making Squidward irritated.\nSpongeBob, struggling to blow away the shell, ends up blowing it so hard sand comes out and lands on Squidward. SpongeBob comes to Squidward and blows off the sand that landed on Squidward, as well as his face. Seeing that there is a huge pile of sand on his yard, SpongeBob sets the blower to REVERSE, sucking up the sand pile, but the reef blower starts to break apart and throws out sand.\nSpongeBob opens up the zipper behind the reef blower and puts the excess sand that was thrown out in there. He tries to start it again, but it does not work. This prompts SpongeBob to pull the handle of the reef blower very far. Once he feels he is far enough, he lets go and quickly zips through the distance he went back onto the blower. SpongeBob starts sucking up the entire ocean, causing Squidward to almost suffocate, but the reef blower explodes due to over capacity and shoots all the water sucked up back out again. The episode ends with SpongeBob happy that his lawn is clean, while Squidward's lawn is filled with sand."}
{"prompt": "Tea at the Treedome", "completion": "The episode starts with SpongeBob jellyfishing, only to stumble upon a land squirrel fighting a clam. He attempts to save her, but she saves herself just before the clam eats SpongeBob. After the squirrel, named Sandy, saves SpongeBob, the two greet each other and start bonding. When he notices the air helmet she uses to help her breathe, he convinces her that he likes air too, too embarrassed to admit he does not know what air is. Afterwards, Sandy tells SpongeBob to come over to her treedome for tea and cookies, and gives him a map of where her treedome is.\nSpongeBob goes to Patrick to tell him about what he went through. When Patrick hears from SpongeBob that Sandy wears a \"hat full of air,\" he misinterprets this as a statement that she \"puts on airs,\" and that he needs to be fancy by putting his pinky out. The next day, SpongeBob arrives to Sandy's home, but when he goes inside, he realizes the treedome is entirely filled with air. SpongeBob starts having trouble breathing and begins to dehydrate as a result, but will not admit this to Sandy.\nAs Sandy is showing her house, SpongeBob attempts to use a birdbath to absorb water, only for the bird to angrily kick him out. Patrick reminds him to put his pinky out, and SpongeBob also brings flowers for Sandy. SpongeBob asks Sandy for water when she asks if he needs anything, but misinterprets this as needing a vase with water inside for the flowers. When Sandy leaves, SpongeBob desperately wants to get out of the treedome, but before he gets out, he remembers Patrick's advice, \"When in doubt, pinky out,\" and remains in the treedome despite being severely dehydrated.\nSandy comes back with the water vase for the flowers, and attempts to start talking to SpongeBob again. When an oven timer inside her treedome goes off, Sandy leaves again. SpongeBob starts wondering if he needs the water in the vase, repeatedly telling himself he does not need it, but eventually relents. SpongeBob drinks all the water in the vase and bolts for the door, only for Patrick to come inside and prevent him from leaving. Patrick says that everything will be fine, but as he walks and stays inside the treedome, he starts choking due to the lack of water as well.\nThe two attempt to get out, and when Sandy comes to them with some tea and cookies, she is shocked when she sees the two have dried up. Sandy quickly brings water helmets for them so they can survive in the treedome and tells them if they needed water, then they should've asked for it. The trio happily drink some tea while the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Bubblestand", "completion": "The episode begins with SpongeBob walking outside to breathe in the peacefulness of the neighborhood in the morning. Suddenly, he begins to loudly build a bubble stand, much to the annoyance of Squidward, who demands SpongeBob to be quiet while he is practicing his clarinet-playing. SpongeBob stops for a time, takes a few tentative taps of his hammer, and then quickly finishes construction before Squidward has a chance to complain again.\nAt the newly built stand, SpongeBob offers customers an opportunity to blow a bubble for twenty-five cents. Patrick comes by and asks to try it out. However, he does not have any money, so he \"borrows\" a quarter from SpongeBob to pay for it. Unfortunately, Patrick's strained blowing fails to produce a bubble. SpongeBob offers to teach him for an extra quarter, which he happily \"loans\" to Patrick. SpongeBob then demonstrates his somewhat peculiar, yet effective, bubble-blowing technique. SpongeBob's technique produces, among others, a massive elephant-shaped bubble that gets stuck in Squidward's house and pops.\nThe fuming Squidward comes out and approaches the now ostensibly closed bubble stand. He demands to know how they can cause so much disruption just by blowing bubbles. SpongeBob explains that he is creating art and utilizing his technique to its fullest potential. Squidward scoffs at SpongeBob's ideas of art and marketing, sending SpongeBob and Patrick back to their homes in shame. Still snickering, Squidward begins to examine the bubble wand out of growing curiosity. As he tries to blow a bubble himself, SpongeBob quickly comes out and tells Squidward to pay a quarter, shocking him. Squidward reluctantly lays down a quarter for the bubble, suggesting that it is a very simple feat.\nSquidward attempts to impress the two with his skill, to no avail. All the while, SpongeBob and Patrick try to convince him to use the technique. Fed up, Squidward furiously and mockingly copies their technique, finally screaming into the wand in anger. His screams end up producing a giant bubble, thoroughly impressing SpongeBob and Patrick.\nSquidward heads back inside his house and begins to play his clarinet once more, with SpongeBob and Patrick chanting his name while dancing. However, the giant bubble descends and encapsulates Squidward's house, unearthing it and floating with it up in the air.\nWhen at last Squidward looks outside to greet his \"fans,\" he sees himself high above the ground with SpongeBob and Patrick little more than specks. The bubble then pops with explosive force, prompting SpongeBob and Patrick to look at each other nervously and retreat to their houses.\nOnce Squidward's house floats back down to the ground, Squidward ends the episode by letting out a few final feeble notes from his clarinet."}
{"prompt": "Ripped Pants", "completion": "The episode begins with SpongeBob and Sandy having a good time at Goo Lagoon. A lobster named Larry comes by and asks them if they want to do some weights. They accept, despite SpongeBob not being in the mood to do weights. Larry and Sandy do several impressive weight stunts, while SpongeBob tries to pick up a stick. When SpongeBob strains to pick up a stick with two marshmallows on the sides, he accidentally rips his pants.\nThis causes everyone to laugh, prompting SpongeBob to continue making ripped pants jokes. After a while, though, SpongeBob's ripped pants jokes start to annoy the people in Goo Lagoon. At some point, SpongeBob fakes himself drowning in order to make a ripped pants joke, but this causes everyone, most importantly Sandy, to get disgusted with SpongeBob and continue playing without him.\nSpongeBob tries to figure out more ripped pants jokes as the last one did not work but realizes nobody is paying attention to him, and tears off his pants during the course of one of these jokes. The pair of pants suddenly takes on a personality and deserts SpongeBob as well. He sees some other people who make big mistakes. SpongeBob decides to sing a song about how he lost his friends due to ripping his pants. Sandy forgives SpongeBob for what he did, and he rips his underwear while signing Larry's shorts, making him embarrassed and ending the episode shortly after."}
{"prompt": "Jellyfishing", "completion": "The episode begins with a jellyfish swimming by SpongeBob's house, where SpongeBob and Patrick then observe it through a massive telescope protruding from a window in SpongeBob's house. They then slide down ropes (causing them to get rope burn that literally produces flames on their hands) and assmble their jellyfish nets, before SpongeBob puts on his glasses. They prepare for jellyfishing like professionals, but then meet Squidward and ask him if he wants to join them. He says that he cannot go with them because he is \"busy\" and goes bicycling instead. SpongeBob asks Squidward if he can join them next time. Squidward sarcastically says yes and goes down the road. SpongeBob does not understand the sarcasm and suspects Squidward never has time for them; Patrick says it's because Squidward doesn't like them, but SpongeBob convinces Patrick that's not the case and plans to go jellyfishing with him eventually.\nUnfortunately, while he is biking, Squidward has an accident involving a jellyfish and gets his tentacles tangled in his bike's pedals, causing him to veer out of control, tumble down a cliff, and inexplicably explode when he hits the bottom, leaving him ultimately wheelchair-bound. SpongeBob and Patrick decide that what Squidward needs is a \"Best Day Ever\" when he returns home, bandaged essentially everywhere on his body besides his eyes. The Best Day Ever begins at Squidward's house, where Patrick offers Squidward some alphabet soup. Patrick blows the hot soup onto Squidward's bandaged face several times before SpongeBob says that soup is not a good idea. SpongeBob then suggests that some music would be good, and gets Squidward's clarinet. He blows a bad note before realizing that his lips are too dry, and goes through several exaggerated motions of trying to wet his lips. A disgusted Patrick soon violently snatches the instrument away from SpongeBob, declaring music not to be a good thing for Squidward either.\nSpongeBob and Patrick then declare that a jellyfishing expedition would be in order for the \"Best Day Ever.\" They then go to Jellyfish Fields, SpongeBob tells Patrick to give a net to Squidward, while he finds \"a good specimen.\" Patrick explains that Squidward must, \"firmly grasp [the net] in [his] hand,\" but when Patrick fails to put a jellyfishing net in Squidward's cast-covered hand, he gets frustrated and he stabs it through Squidward's palm, much to his chagrin and pain.\nHe is not into it at first, but when a jellyfish stings him, he wheels after it for revenge. He manages to catch the jellyfish and bangs his net triumphantly against a pink mass. While Squidward does this, the pink mass arises to reveal itself as a queen jellyfish who is irritated by the banging. The queen jellyfish chases after Squidward, while SpongeBob and Patrick obliviously cheer him on until the queen jellyfish zaps Squidward with an extremely massive sting, leaving their cheering replaced with cringing at poor Squidward's literally shocking misfortune.\nThe next day, SpongeBob and Patrick covered in band-aids meet outside Squidward's house, where they see he is now life-support-bound and attempt to talk to him but are ignored. After he is unable to enter his home, they apologize and give Squidward the jellyfish that he caught the previous day as an apology. SpongeBob hopefully asks Squidward if he still isn’t mad at them. Sure enough, he opens the jar and frees the jellyfish, and Patrick takes it as a yes, before he and SpongeBob run off into the distance while being stung. As Squidward laughs, the Queen Jellyfish finds him and stings him again, destroying his life-support and shattering his body cast. A completely blackened Squidward can only say, \"Ow\" as the episode abruptly ends."}
{"prompt": "Plankton!", "completion": "The episode opens at the Krusty Krab. Squidward sends SpongeBob an order for a Krabby Patty, which through a sleight-of-hand trick SpongeBob performs seems to come out through Squidward's nose. After SpongeBob makes the patty, however, it begins to move seemingly on its own and makes its way towards the front door. Mr. Krabs stops the patty in its tracks and reveals that the patty was being stolen by none other than Krabs' diminutive nemesis, Plankton. Krabs places his foe on a plate and flings him back to the Chum Bucket across the street while Plankton exclaims that he will return. Mr. Krabs explains to SpongeBob that Plankton is his arch-competitor, and has been trying and failing to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula for an untold amount of years.\nLater that night, after the Krusty Krab closes, SpongeBob says goodbye to Mr. Krabs and leaves. On his way home, Plankton stops SpongeBob and tries to convince him that he and the fry cook are somehow friends (or should be since they are both invertebrates), and that as such SpongeBob should come to Plankton's birthday, which he claims is the following day. Plankton gives SpongeBob a golden spatula and says that, \"friends give each other gifts.\" SpongeBob then guesses that Plankton would like a booster seat. Plankton sounds happy with this proposition, but declines. Plankton tells SpongeBob that, for his birthday, he wants SpongeBob to give him a Krabby Patty. SpongeBob loudly and angrily refuses, citing that Plankton just wants to make friends with him in order to gain access to the Krabby Patty. He also feels sure that Plankton's birthday was not going to even be the following day, and runs back home, refusing to give Plankton a Krabby Patty whether they become friends or not. Plankton, however, refuses to give up and proclaims that SpongeBob will \"hand-deliver it to [him] personally.\"\nLater that night, as SpongeBob is sleeping, Plankton maliciously enters his head through a pore and makes his way to SpongeBob's brain. He attaches a mind control device to the brain and hijacks SpongeBob's mind and body, forcing him to walk out of his house and through Squidward's house, where he insults the cephalopod. At this point, SpongeBob realizes that Plankton has hijacked his body and tries to tell him to let him go, but Plankton refuses, laughs sadistically, and makes SpongeBob leave exit the house, leaving Squidward feeling nauseous by what he just saw. After Plankton forces SpongeBob to pass through Patrick's house and tosses him aside, he then forces the sponge into and out of the Krusty Krab where he steals a Krabby Patty. He brings it to an analyzer inside the Chum Bucket, which is designed to figure out the ingredients of whatever is dropped into it. As Plankton cruelly gloats over his victory and begins to force SpongeBob to drop the Krabby Patty, SpongeBob sadly laments his failure to protect it, lovingly describing the Krabby Patty's ingredients and succulence. A hungry Plankton leaps out of SpongeBob's head and onto the Krabby Patty, but bounces off of it and falls into the analyzer, thus trapping himself inside his own computer screen. With his mind and body now freed from Plankton's control, SpongeBob happily walks home with the Krabby Patty in hand, ignoring Plankton's angry demands for him to bring it back, his last plea being, \"I'll settle for some fries!\" ending the episode shortly after.\n"}
{"prompt": "Naughty Nautical Neighbors", "completion": "On a seemingly normal day, Squidward has made a delicious soufflé, but SpongeBob and Patrick's constant laughing distracts him from enjoying it. Squidward sees that they are having a private conversation with bubbles. They whisper a message into the bubble wand instead of blowing into it, and when the bubble pops, the message can be heard.\nAnnoyed by this, Squidward makes bubbles of his own using the liquid from his soufflé and proceeds to insult the two while imitating their voices to ruin their friendship. Thinking the bubbles are from each other, SpongeBob and Patrick become angry and get into a fight, eventually declaring that they are no longer friends before storming back to their houses (unbeknownst to them that Squidward is the one who caused this).\nSquidward comes outside and eats his soufflé while laughing after Patrick squashed himself with his own house, but in doing so, he chokes on the fork he was using and faints. Patrick witnesses this and saves his life by performing CPR on him (which is basically blowing him up and as the air comes out, the fork can be seen spluttering in between his lips).\nSquidward thanks him and he becomes Patrick's new friend, inviting him into his house to watch him practice his clarinet composition called \"Solitude in E Minor.\" Despite Patrick claiming to love music, he immediately falls asleep as soon as Squidward plays a single note.\nMeanwhile, a lonely SpongeBob tries to cheer himself up by drawing faces on three of his fingers and pretending they are his \"friends,\" but this only results in him bursting into tears.\nBack outside, Squidward drags the still asleep Patrick out of his house, and in the process, he throws his back out. SpongeBob sees this as an opportunity to help him and, despite protests from Squidward, he dives into the latter's back and cracks it back into place. Squidward screams but immediately feels better. But he makes the mistake of referring to SpongeBob as his \"friend\" while thanking him, thus making SpongeBob believe that Squidward is his new best friend.\nThey both walk into Squidward's house, where SpongeBob plays a song (badly) for Squidward on his double bass (which he thinks is a bassinet) and when Patrick, now fully awake, appears in the window and interrupts the song, SpongeBob destroys the instrument in a fit of rage. Squidward explodes in anger and kicks him out as a result, and decides to take a relaxing bubble bath, but is horrified to find Patrick, lounging in the tub and warming up a scrub brush and a bar of soap for him. Squidward furiously orders him to leave, but SpongeBob appears through the window and discovers this, causing the two to argue again. This drives Squidward crazy, and he flees his house, hiding in a trash can outside. Seeing the huge mess he created, Squidward realizes he needs a plan to get SpongeBob and Patrick to become friends again (and thus leave him alone).\nSquidward decides to invite SpongeBob and Patrick to a dinner party (without telling either of them that the other is coming) to repair their friendship. When they arrive, they are still mad at each other. Squidward tries to get them back together by offering them soda, but the situation devolves into a competition to see who can drink the most soda and thus become Squidward's friend. Eventually, Squidward runs out of soda and leaves to get some more, telling the two to stay and \"chat.\"\nWhile he is gone, SpongeBob and Patrick, who are both extremely fat from all the soda they drank, still refuse to talk or even look at each other. SpongeBob then hiccups a small bubble that makes a burping sound upon popping, which amuses them both and they become friends again. However, they create so many bubbles from laughing that it causes Squidward's house to explode. Upon arriving back and seeing the destruction, Squidward angrily tells the two to leave, and slams the door (which is somehow still standing) shut. A bubble pops near the door, causing it to fall over and crush Squidward, who moans \"Ohhh! My back...,\" concluding the episode."}
{"prompt": "Boating School", "completion": "An excited SpongeBob rides his unicycle to Mrs. Puff's Boating School for his driving exam to start the episode, eager to finally get his driver's license. When he arrives, he throws his unicycle away, falsely assuming he will definitely pass and no longer needs it. Having taken the oral exam 37 times before, SpongeBob is able to answer the questions before Mrs. Puff even asks them. However, upon reaching the driving portion, SpongeBob gets nervous and quickly loses control of the boat and crashes into a lighthouse, causing Mrs. Puff's body to inflate.\nLater that night, SpongeBob complains about his failure to Gary, who asks him to go for a walk, which he declines. Patrick is then heard talking to him from a walkie-talkie under his covers. He asks SpongeBob to head to his closet for a \"surprise,\" and SpongeBob finds Patrick wearing his clothes and calling himself \"Patrick SquarePants.\" SpongeBob is too depressed to laugh at this, and explains his problem to Patrick and mentions that he needs someone to help him think straight during the exam. Patrick quickly devises a plan. He puts a walkie-talkie inside SpongeBob's head so that he can talk SpongeBob through the test, hiding the antenna with a cowboy hat.\nThe next day, SpongeBob goes back to take the test again. When asked to start the boat, he initially panics, but Patrick's instructions keep him calm. Just after SpongeBob puts the boat in drive, he almost floors the pedal, but Patrick tells him to \"Freeze, mister!,\" and SpongeBob's foot stops just before it touches the pedal. Patrick then tells him to use his big toe on the pedal, and SpongeBob's toe pops out of his shoe and it presses the pedal. This is followed by a montage of SpongeBob acing the exam, interspersed with shots of Patrick eating SpongeBob's food, and reading his diary while helping him.\nMrs. Puff is floored by SpongeBob's sudden improvement and jokingly suggests that his success is due to an antenna under his hat through which \"some guy miles away from here\" is giving him all the answers. SpongeBob (and Patrick) finds this hilarious until Mrs. Puff tells him it would be cheating to do so. Upon realizing he has been cheating, SpongeBob goes into hysterics, making Patrick realize that his method is bad. Devastated and ashamed about what he did, Patrick flees to his house, crying. SpongeBob starts driving wildly all over the course and sobbing, while Mrs. Puff, in a panic, tries desperately to stop him. SpongeBob is too distraught to listen and crashes the boat, failing the test again, and the inflated Mrs. Puff is taken to the hospital. As the episode ends with SpongeBob leaving boating school, he finds Gary riding his unicycle. SpongeBob rides off on it, with Gary atop his head, and happily rides off to visit Mrs. Puff at the hospital, thus ending the episode from there."}
{"prompt": "Pizza Delivery", "completion": "As the episode starts, it is closing time at the Krusty Krab, and Squidward answers a last-minute phone call from a customer. Just as he is about to tell the customer the restaurant is closed, Mr. Krabs suddenly appears and snatches the phone from Squidward's hands. The customer tells Mr. Krabs that he wants to order a pizza and have it delivered, an order Mr. Krabs happily accepts, knowing he could get extra money. Squidward protests this by saying that the restaurant does not serve pizza nor do they deliver, but Mr. Krabs spontaneously makes a pizza out of Krabby Patties and forces Squidward and SpongeBob to deliver it.\nAfter SpongeBob does a vehicle inspection on a boatmobile, Squidward tells him to drive. However, SpongeBob says that he is still in boating school, but Squidward does not want to drive either. He says the customer is around the corner and advises SpongeBob to do what he does in school. As expected, SpongeBob panics when he tries to shift the boat into reverse and ends up \"backing up\" for miles and miles until the boat runs out of gas in the middle of a big desert. Squidward complains about the situation and kicks the boat out of frustration after SpongeBob mentions the pizza is getting cold. This causes the boat to suddenly drive off back to the Krusty Krab, leaving the two stranded and forced to continue their delivery on foot.\nThroughout the journey, the duo encounters numerous mishaps. First, SpongeBob tries a pioneer trick he claims to have seen in a movie where he listens to the ground and hears a truck coming. When SpongeBob tries to get the driver's attention by doing a ridiculous dance in the middle of the road, the driver speeds up and Squidward pushes SpongeBob out of the way so he does not get mowed down. Later, the pizza box gets caught in the wind. Squidward tells SpongeBob to let go of the pizza until they see a tornado. He then says to hang on to the pizza, which saves their lives after SpongeBob turns it into a parachute.\nUpon landing on solid ground, Squidward panics when he cannot find the road. SpongeBob says that moss points towards civilization and that they should go in the direction at which the moss is pointing. Squidward goes in the other direction, unaware that they almost found a city.\nThey become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests ridiculous things to eat. Squidward wants the pizza instead. SpongeBob runs away from Squidward. Squidward pauses for a moment so that when SpongeBob crashes into Squidward, he tries to grab it, but SpongeBob notices a giant rock that he claims the pioneers drove for miles. Squidward is incredulous at this claim and tries to tell SpongeBob to forget about the pioneers, saying that there are none left because of their unusual habits and traveling methods. However, he quickly changes his mind after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock and he chases after him for a ride out of the desert. With the giant rock, they drive it to the customer's house.\nUnfortunately, their journey does not pay off very well. The customer is at first excited to get his pizza, but then frowns for a second and asks where is his drink, Diet Dr. Kelp, which he claims he had ordered. A confused SpongeBob checks the order, which says that the customer did not ask for a drink (though it is somewhat implied that Mr. Krabs either hung up the phone before the customer could finish his order or did not hear him correctly). Filled with anger, the customer harshly berates SpongeBob and refuses to take the pizza or pay for it before throwing it at SpongeBob's face and aggressively slamming the door in front of his face.\nSpongeBob walks over to Squidward, who tries to console him, but his attempt ends in vain and SpongeBob collapses to the ground crying while also absorbing his tears. Appalled at how the customer treated SpongeBob and refused to accept the pizza all because of a drink (making this long journey and the ridiculous obstacles the duo went through a complete waste of time), Squidward furiously confronts the rude customer by brutally slamming the pizza into his face as a deserved payback, claiming it to be \"on the house.\"\nSquidward then cheers up SpongeBob by saying that the customer took the pizza and \"ate the whole thing in one bite,\" even without a drink. Squidward calmly asks to be taken home, but SpongeBob instead drives them back to the Krusty Krab as he states that they have enough time to make it back to work, which is comically revealed to be right across the street, much to Squidward's dismay, as the screen fades black."}
{"prompt": "Home Sweet Pineapple", "completion": "A crowd of hungry nematodes arrive in Bikini Bottom early in the morning and eat a variety of items. Upon reaching SpongeBob's pineapple house, they pull out straws and start drinking the juice inside it. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Gary are inside, sleeping, as everything starts to shrink. SpongeBob and Gary wake up and rush into the living room as SpongeBob calls Squidward on the phone, and Squidward asks if it is time for SpongeBob to ruin his day. Then Patrick gets up asking, \"Is it already time to ruin Squid's day?\" before rushing over elegantly dressed. When Squidward sees that there is nothing left of SpongeBob's house save what seems to be small pebble, he starts elatedly saying goodbye to SpongeBob, but throws a party inside his house, with confetti and streamers flying out of his front windows. Now that the house is no longer there, SpongeBob says that he will have to move back in with his mom and dad. However, Patrick convinces SpongeBob to build a new house.\nLater, SpongeBob and Patrick attempt to build another pineapple house, but it ends up being a scale model, meaning SpongeBob has no choice but to move away, until Patrick offers to allow SpongeBob and Gary to stay at his house. When SpongeBob and Gary try to sleep, Patrick hogs his rock, which he and SpongeBob are using as a blanket, and they get into a tug-of-war. Not only does Patrick snore so loud that SpongeBob put corks in his ears, but he also begins drooling in his sleep. SpongeBob absorbs the drool and waddles over to Patrick to put a giant cork inside his mouth. Later, Patrick has dreams that spiders are attacking him, and hits SpongeBob repeatedly with the rock, crushing him. SpongeBob decides to sleep far away from Patrick, but when Patrick has another nightmare, he sleep-runs to where SpongeBob is and pounds him with his rock some more before heading back to where he was and going back to sleep the way he normally does.\nSpongeBob gives up sleeping at Patrick's house and goes to sleep at Squidward's. SpongeBob asks Squidward for a glass of water, and Squidward, who is still half-asleep, brings him one. When they say goodnight to each other, Squidward realizes that SpongeBob is sleeping at his house, and angrily kicks Gary and SpongeBob out, leaving both of them without a place to stay for the rest of the night.\nThe next day, Squidward gets up early so he can see SpongeBob move back with his parents. When SpongeBob's parents arrive, Patrick begins crying hysterically and attempts to drag SpongeBob's family's car to a stop while Squidward starts dancing and singing. SpongeBob buries the pebble from the beginning of the episode where his house used to be because it holds too many memories. He begins to tear up, and one tear falls on the spot where the pebble was planted. However, the \"pebble\" is actually a seed, and SpongeBob's tear waters the pineapple seed, which creates a massive vine. This vine sprouts a new pineapple house identical to the previous one, drops it on top of Squidward, and retreats underground. SpongeBob is happy his house came back as he, his parents, and Patrick rush over to go inside to find everything back to where it belongs. Just before the episode closes, SpongeBob then goes over to tell Squidward, who is underneath the floor, that his house is back forever, much to the cephalopod's chagrin."}

Squidward is quickly annoyed at his neighbors' antics, and tell them that Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy actually live in a nursing home, having retired years earlier. SpongeBob and Patrick decide that these crime fighters have resume their careers, and go to the Shady Shoals Rest Home, where they are met by its caretaker. He escorts the friends to the superheroes and tells them not to surprise them. SpongeBob tells them that superheroes should no longer be retired, but they should continue to fight evil. Mermaid Man creates a panic when he hears the word, \"evil,\" leading the caretaker of the nursing home to throw SpongeBob and Patrick out for surprising them.\nWhile the former crime fighters are going to the cafeteria for lunch, SpongeBob arrives and makes an inspiring speech about how superheroes should not be retired. After SpongeBob is done with his speech, Mermaid Man angrily tells SpongeBob that needs to eat his lunch before the caretaker comes again and throws him right out to his house for surprising them again.\nSpongeBob and Patrick come up with a new plan to free the superheroes from retirement: SpongeBob, disguised as a woman, \"complains\" about the weight of a purse he is holding, and Patrick, disguised as a criminal, \"steals\" it. Suddenly, Barnacle Boy, who is in no way deceived by the disguises, comes to SpongeBob and says that they will always be retired, because there is not enough evil activity for them to thwart. Mermaid Man interrupts him and replies that there is always evil. They start arguing, until SpongeBob interrupts them and says that he and Patrick have painted their invisible boatmobile. After telling SpongeBob and Patrick that their invisible boatmobile is supposed to be invisible, Barnacle Boy becomes fed up with SpongeBob and Patrick bothering and irritating him and Mermaid Man as he decides to end the argument and convinces Mermaid Man that evil is right in front of them. He takes out their rings, and they resume their careers. The newly reunited crime-fighters get into a fight with SpongeBob and Patrick, who are impervious to their attacks and joyed that they have brought their heroes out of retirement. Finally, the heroes are lucky: they are helped by elderly residents of a nursing home, who pick up SpongeBob and Patrick and throw them away from the retirement home. The heroes then celebrate on a job well done.\nEventually, a new show of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy is created: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. The duo play checkers, then suddenly, the phone rings. Mermaid Man picks up upside-down, fails to hear the person on the other line, and hangs up, thinking the phone is broken. The announcer says, \"Will our heroes ever get their phone fixed? Tune in next week and find out.\" After watching the new episode SpongeBob enjoyed it as he thought it was better than the old show, and when SpongeBob winks, the words appear: \"Wink!\""}

Mr. Krabs tells him to go home and get some rest, but this does not help matters at all. \nWhile SpongeBob is gone, Mr. Krabs has Squidward take over for him, but Squidward just burns all the food and drives away all the customers. Mr. Krabs worries about losing money and decides to visit SpongeBob's house, where he finds everything in disarray. Mr. Krabs explains to SpongeBob that if he remembers how to make a Krabby Patty, he will regain his confidence and be able to return to work. It takes several days, but eventually SpongeBob remembers how to make a Krabby Patty properly from his frustrations. \nSpongeBob returns to the Krusty Krab, where Bubble Bass confronts him again. SpongeBob serves him his meal confidently, knowing full well that he didn't forget the pickles, but Bubble Bass announces that he has forgotten the pickles again and laughs at SpongeBob's failure. However, when he looks closely at Bubble Bass's mouth, SpongeBob realizes that Bubble Bass has been tricking him by hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time to avoid paying, as well as the pickles from last time, and even someone's car keys, exposing his burglary. Panting, Bubble Bass immediately flees the restaurant to avoid punishment, and everyone gives three cheers for SpongeBob. SpongeBob then asks them to give three cheers for Squidward for taking his place while he was gone, but the crowd boos Squidward instead because of the awful job he did. Squidward’s frown gets droopier and droopier with every boo (they do it 4 times), but SpongeBob assumes everyone is cheering instead of booing. The episode ends with one customer yelling, \"Boo, you stink!\""}
{"prompt": "Hall Monitor", "completion": "At Mrs. Puff's Boating School, it is time to select the hall monitor for the day. Mrs. Puff notices that SpongeBob is the only one who has yet to serve as hall monitor. SpongeBob then approaches Mrs. Puff, and after desperately attempting to find another candidate, she is forced to give the hall monitor duties to SpongeBob.\nAfter being elected as Boating School Hall Monitor, SpongeBob gives an extremely long speech, which ends up lasting the entire school day (and thus his whole tenure as hall monitor), which puts Mrs. Puff and all of his schoolmates to sleep. Out of sympathy, Mrs. Puff allows SpongeBob to at least wear his uniform until the next day, though privately apprehensive of her decision.\nHowever, SpongeBob goes above and beyond the call of duty and decides to become the \"hall monitor\" of the city, with disastrous results. His activities include an atrociously vain attempt to direct traffic, resulting in a massive pile-up, and scaring a couple out of their house in the guise of the \"Open Window Maniac,\" with the intention of showing them the \"dangers\" of leaving a house window open. Later, SpongeBob comes across Patrick eating a strawberry ice cream cone and labels him a criminal after Patrick drops the ice cream on the ground.\nThen, a newspaper boy comes up to SpongeBob and Patrick, and gives them a newspaper with the headline \"Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom.\" SpongeBob looks at the newspaper headline alerting about a maniac causing trouble around town, blind to the fact that he is himself the article's subject. SpongeBob suggests they stop this maniac, which gives a saddened Patrick the chance to, in his words, \"be good\" by becoming SpongeBob's \"deputy.\" They end up getting ice cream twice as part of Patrick's \"ex-criminal\" advice and then decide to split up to find the maniac, communicating using walkie-talkies.\nSeconds after SpongeBob runs off, two police officers pull up next to Patrick. They ask him if he has seen the maniac, showing him a wanted poster with a picture of SpongeBob, which he at first mistakes for an imagined, separate maniac, and screams with terror at the mere sight of the poster.\nThe cops patiently assure him that it's just a drawing and not the real thing, and instruct him to tell them if he has seen the person when they show the picture. Patrick agrees to cooperate, but he keeps screaming whenever the police show him the sketch. Eventually, the cops decide to have a little fun and repeatedly show and hide the picture as Patrick screams every single time. The officers then drive off, suggesting to Patrick that he stays indoors and take the ice cream cone off his head.\nSoon, night suddenly falls and Patrick becomes frightened. He calls SpongeBob and asks him to return. SpongeBob comes back as Patrick finds a poster of the maniac before he sees SpongeBob in the distance across the street under a streetlight. However, Patrick recognizes him as the maniac rather than SpongeBob. He alerts SpongeBob through his walkie-talkie, and SpongeBob attempts to escape the maniac. Everywhere he goes, Patrick tells him the maniac is there, causing SpongeBob to hide in a mailbox for safety. Upon being told that the maniac is also in there, he bursts his arms and legs out of the mailbox, sprinting around the city in a blind panic. In his terrified state, he topples several buildings and crashes through a fence covered in the wanted posters. After seeing a poster from the fence, he finally realizes that he is the maniac who has been reported in the newspaper and is being pursued by law enforcement.\nThe police arrive to arrest SpongeBob, but Mrs. Puff appears and scolds SpongeBob for his foolish actions and destruction of the city, much to his sadness. She then explains the situation to them, letting out that he is her responsibility. The police interpret this as taking responsibility for the crimes, and she is arrested instead.\nSometime later at Boating School, Mrs. Puff is working with the class on their essay while she is being broadcast on TV from jail, until she tells SpongeBob that he needs to see her after class, \"six months from now.\""}
{"prompt": "Jellyfish Jam", "completion": "A jellyfish insists on following SpongeBob home after a day out at Jellyfish Fields, so SpongeBob decides on keeping it as a pet at his home. Squidward warns SpongeBob that jellyfish are wild animals and that he should not attempt to domesticate it, but SpongeBob completely ignores him. At home, SpongeBob dances with the jellyfish to loud techno rave music, which annoys Squidward to no end. After 12 hours of this form of nonstop partying, SpongeBob finally decides that it is time to go to bed, but this jellyfish does not want to stop. SpongeBob eventually forces it to go to bed by tying a leash around it and ties it to his bed. Gary tries to tell SpongeBob he should not be keeping a wild animal, but SpongeBob does not listen. During the night, while SpongeBob sleeps, the jellyfish escapes and brings several other jellyfish into the house.\nThe next morning, SpongeBob wakes up to find his living room filled with dozens of dancing jellyfish. He attempts to make them leave, but to no avail. Squidward, annoyed that the music has been going on for 18 hours and prevented him from sleeping, angrily calls SpongeBob on his conch phone to tell him that he has had enough of the loud music. A jellyfish picks it up and sprays him with jelly over the phone. Irritated, Squidward decides that \"two can play at this,\" and starts loudly playing his clarinet, angering the jellyfish with his terrible playing, and causing them to start destroying SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob asks Squidward to play his clarinet a little \"better,\" as an insulted Squidward sarcastically responds to this request. However, Squidward intentionally starts playing even worse and much louder with speakers and a microphone. This prompts the jellyfish to angrily go to his house, as he cowardly tries to promise to stop playing, but they sting him before returning to SpongeBob's house. A sting-covered Squidward says to SpongeBob, \"Everybody's a critic. You won't be hearing from me anymore,\" and gives him his clarinet before leaving. The jellyfish hastily take it from SpongeBob, break it in half, set it on fire, and dance around it.\nThis brings SpongeBob to the limits of his patience, and he attempts to remove the stereo system, destroying it in the process. The enraged jellyfish begin stinging and chasing him. SpongeBob and Gary go up to the roof of the house, but the swarm follows them outside and surrounds them. SpongeBob tells Gary that he was right about attempting to keep a wild animal in his house, then Gary soothes the jellyfish away by clicking his eyes together. SpongeBob tells Gary to keep doing this and puts him on his head, walking downstairs and out the front door, followed by the swarm. As he leads them back to Jellyfish Fields, more sounds accompany Gary's clicking, eventually becoming a full-fledged symphony. After resettling the jellyfish, SpongeBob quickly returns home with Gary.\nIn the last scene, SpongeBob shakes hands with Gary's eyeball as the French narrator declares, \"Today, SpongeBob has learned one of the sea’s harshest lessons; wild animals can throw very wild parties.\" Then the severely stung Squidward is shown settling into his bathtub to recover from his stings."}
{"prompt": "Sandy's Rocket", "completion": "SpongeBob visits Sandy's treedome, and then sees that Sandy has built a rocket ship. Sandy explains to him that she is going to the moon, and SpongeBob begs her to take him with her. Although she immediately insists that he cannot come and that this trip is for science and not for fun, and also tells him that there is not enough room for him, SpongeBob's begging ultimately convinces her to let him come with her.\nThat night, Patrick comes to SpongeBob's house and gives him some \"Alien Repellent,\" which they sneak into Sandy's treedome to spray on the windows. Even though they agree to only spray the windows, Patrick inadvertently enters the rocket, and SpongeBob follows. After playing with the ship's various features, SpongeBob accidentally starts up the rocket and it starts to launch, which makes Sandy wake up and figure out the cause. SpongeBob and Patrick fall right down the rocket. Luckily, the lack of gravity takes over them while they're in outer space. The ship loops over the moon a few times and falls back down to Earth, then crashes back to Bikini Bottom (next to SpongeBob's house). SpongeBob and Patrick convinced that they're now on the Moon, think that the aliens are projecting their memories onto the environment to trick them.\nThey begin catching everyone with Sandy's net guns (intended for harvesting moon rocks), believing the citizens of Bikini Bottom are aliens. Eventually, they capture everyone in Bikini Bottom. When Sandy arrives and tries to chew them out for ruining her experiment, SpongeBob and Patrick shoot their net guns at her, capturing her too. Sandy attempts to explain the truth to them, but they slam the door in her face. Suddenly, SpongeBob is convinced that Patrick is an alien. Patrick attempts to shoot him before he has a chance to capture him but ends up shooting and capturing himself (he had his net gun pointed the wrong way). SpongeBob starts the rocket again to return home, and when it reaches the moon, the rocket crashes on top of it, having run out of gas. Noticing that things are different, SpongeBob looks out the window to see the Earth where he realizes his mistake. All the Bikini Bottomites, who are being stored in the cargo hold of the ship, end the episode saying: \"SpongeBob, we aliens would like a word with you.\""}
{"prompt": "Squeaky Boots", "completion": "The episode begins on Pearl's birthday, where Mr. Krabs attempts to cheaply entertain her party guests. When this does not receive a warm reception, he moves on to presenting Pearl with his present. She opens the package, eagerly hoping for a pair of the popular flipper slippers all her friends wear. What she finds instead is a pair of rubber fishing boots, a real bargain for Mr. Krabs but a mortifying gift for her.\nLeft stuck with a two-dollar pair of boots, Mr. Krabs wonders what he can do with them. SpongeBob arrives to ask for his paycheck, and Mr. Krabs decides to play up the value of the boots, telling SpongeBob they are meant only for the world's greatest fry cook. SpongeBob longs to wear such a pair, but Mr. Krabs denies his request until SpongeBob offers up his paycheck in exchange.\nSpongeBob takes to the squeaky new boots immediately, much to the annoyance of Squidward. To Mr. Krabs' ears, the boots merely make the sound of music. That night, Mr. Krabs begins to dream about the cash lining his register, but sounds of squeaking invade his slumber and the squeaky boots appear in his dream jumping in his register. He awakens to see his window opening and closing squeakily. He goes to close it, but he steps into a knothole, breaks his leg literally in two and falls outside.\nLimping back upstairs, he finally closes the window and returns to sleep, but the window opens once more. Repeated attempts eventually yield success, but he breaks his other leg on the way back to his hammock and becomes entangled in it, just as the window resumes squeaking open and closed.\nTrudging to work on bandaged legs, the tired Mr. Krabs looks forward to at least having a successful business day. He arrives to find Squidward leaving for vacation in a huff. Mr. Krabs cannot understand what could be wrong when business is booming, but it soon becomes clear as SpongeBob comes squeaking into view. Enthusiastic as ever about wearing the boots of the world's greatest fry cook, SpongeBob demonstrates how he hopes to live up to the title, performing various feats and squeaking all the while. Mr. Krabs grows ever more weak and weary, retreating to his office for peace. The sounds permeate inside, however, and he decides he must get rid of the boots once and for all.\nSneaking into SpongeBob's house under cover of darkness, Mr. Krabs slips off the boots from the sleeping SpongeBob's feet and brings them back to the Krusty Krab to hide. The next morning, Mr. Krabs is sitting peacefully with his dollar bills when a sobbing SpongeBob enters, apologizing for losing the precious boots, and admitted his belief of his fault. Mr. Krabs attempts to console him with \"magic oven mitts,\" but they do nothing to heal SpongeBob's pain. Unsure of what else to do, Mr. Krabs takes a customer's order. However, the order comes out as a series of squeaks. Horrified, Mr. Krabs soon hears everyone and everything making the dreaded sound.\nDriven to madness, Mr. Krabs confesses that he hid the boots underneath the restaurant's floorboards. He pulls the boots out, takes them to the kitchen and dips them into the fryer before devouring the shriveled footwear. Satisfied, he tells the mystified SpongeBob that he doesn't need special boots to be a great fry cook as he already is one, and so gives SpongeBob his long-overdue paycheck and an extra bonus. Mr. Krabs then heads off on a week-long vacation with Pearl, having finally bought her a pair of Flipper Slippers for the trip. Much to his dismay however, a tell-tale squeak starts hiccuping from him as he drives and continues all the way down the road, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Nature Pants", "completion": "As the episode opens after SpongeBob daydreams about becoming a jellyfish and living in the wilderness, he accidentally starts a fire and Mr. Krabs asks him why he is not concentrating. SpongeBob explains that he wishes to live in Jellyfish Fields with the jellyfish. Mr. Krabs laughs heartily and then explains to SpongeBob that he would not last even one day in the wild and that everything at his job is better than nasty old jellyfish. SpongeBob however, is still confident he can do it on his own and angrily quits his job as a fry cook. Mr. Krabs is shocked, but certain that he will return.\nSpongeBob goes home and starts giving away all his material possessions to his friends. He even gives a tearful Patrick his prized jellyfish net, Ol' Reliable. Sandy comes over and asks SpongeBob if he's having a garage sale. SpongeBob denies it and says that he is giving up all his possessions to go live with the jellyfish. Shocked to hear about this, Sandy asks SpongeBob why he would want to live among the jellyfish and explains that they are cold, mean, and not too bright. SpongeBob however, denies her response and tells everyone that maybe one day they will end up like him. After saying goodbye to all his friends, SpongeBob removes his clothes (except his shoes) and runs away naked while acting like a jellyfish, leaving Sandy and Squidward somewhat confused as to why he took off his pants. They leave after betting on his maximum time (Sandy gives him a week and Squidward gives him 11 mins) while Patrick starts to cry because he  is devastated at the loss of his best friend.\nOnce he arrives at Jellyfish Fields, SpongeBob is glad to be \"home\" and he tries to fit in with the other jellyfish, but cannot get the hang of it. Meanwhile, Patrick and Sandy have a picnic to try to trick SpongeBob into coming back but he resists. Patrick desperately tries to get SpongeBob to return home, but SpongeBob still refuses since he is happy out in the wild. He leaves while Sandy tries to drag the hysterical Patrick away.\nA crazed and heartbroken Patrick soon returns with Ol' Reliable, intent on making SpongeBob his trophy. Patrick shows SpongeBob the jar that he will put him in once he catches him. SpongeBob frantically tries to dissuade Patrick as his former friend chases him through Jellyfish Fields.\nSpongeBob eventually jumps into a jellyfish hive out of Patrick's reach, forcing him to give up. Relieved, SpongeBob takes to eating the jelly inside the hive before the jellyfish return to it. Upon the return of the jellyfish, SpongeBob greets them in a friendly matter, but then realizes Mr. Krabs  and Sandy were right about jellyfish being mean as he is repeatedly stung and chased out of the hive and into a cold wet cave by them. Disheartened, but not giving up yet, SpongeBob tries to sleep in the cave using a fern as a blanket, but the fern doesn't keep him warm enough and all of a sudden, he ultimately feels very itchy. He then removes the fern and finds poison sea urchins on him, forcing him to run out of the cave scratching himself very fast.\nFinally deciding that the wild is not as good as he thought, SpongeBob gives up living in Jellyfish Fields and returns to Bikini Bottom sadly. Upon his return to the pineapple, he realizes his great mistake; he had a wonderful life with many good friends, and he gave it all up for nothing.\nAs SpongeBob opens the door, he is greeted with a \"Welcome Home\" party by his friends. All is forgiven, SpongeBob puts his clothes back on and Mr. Krabs gives him his Krusty Krab employee hat back. Everyone then piles in Squidward for a group hug. However, the poison sea urchin bacteria spreads and everyone except SpongeBob becomes itchy. Therefore, he concludes by stating \"It's great to be home!\"."}
{"prompt": "Opposite Day", "completion": "The episode starts by showing Squidward still asleep, only to be woken up and then annoyed by SpongeBob and Patrick, who came into his house to throw a surprise birthday party for him. When they leave, he shouts that it isn't his birthday and having had enough of SpongeBob and Patrick, decides to move out of Bikini Bottom the next day. That afternoon, he calls Bikini Realty to arrange for his house to be sold, so that he may move out of the neighborhood. He is warned that if his home is surrounded by bad neighbors, the house may not be sold. Squidward is convinced that SpongeBob and Patrick may ruin his chances of selling his house. Squidward thinks that whatever a good neighbor does, SpongeBob and Patrick do the opposite, which gives him an idea.\nA now-goofy Squidward tells SpongeBob that it is Opposite Day the next morning, and that everyone must act opposite to how they usually act. A now-grumpy SpongeBob believes him, and informs Patrick, who stops breathing, until SpongeBob exclaims, \"not that opposite!\" A montage of the two doing \"opposite\" things, such as talking backwards and acting as Gary's pets, is then shown. Squidward's plot soon begins to backfire on him. SpongeBob \"fixes\" (damages) his house, and a shocked Squidward cleans the debris with a bulldozer. SpongeBob concludes that Squidward is acting like him, and he must therefore act like Squidward.\nWhile Squidward is still fixing SpongeBob's house, the real estate agent arrives, and SpongeBob and Patrick both pretend to be like Squidward, giving her a tour of the house, while describing it negatively and doing the opposite of what she asks. When Squidward realizes what is going on, he rushes to his house and attempts to explain the situation to the realtor, who, upon hearing that he is \"Squidward\" as well, finally realizes throughout everything and berates them of intentionally messing with her for it.\nGary comes in with a pickle on his face, resembling Squidward's large nose. He meows with a Squidward-style voice, which is the last straw for her that she angrily storms out and officially declined Squidward's house of being sold. Squidward begs the realtor to sell his house, but she refuses stating she wouldn't sell the house if he was the \"last Squidward to exist on Earth\" and then she storms off.\nSpongeBob and Patrick tells Squidward \"Happy Opposite Day.\" A furious Squidward shows SpongeBob and Patrick how much he \"likes\" (hates) them by attempting to run them over with the bulldozer, scaring SpongeBob and Patrick out of their wits as he is now on the warpath against them. SpongeBob then asks Patrick if he ever feels that Squidward likes them too much before the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Culture Shock", "completion": "The episode opens on another day at the Krusty Krab, with Mr. Krabs manning a free salad bar, SpongeBob preoccupied with cleaning rogue dust particles off a table, and Squidward daydreaming about dancing. Mr. Krabs is getting irritated at the lack of customers when one decides to come in. Ecstatic at finally getting a customer, Mr. Krabs orders SpongeBob to cater to the fish's every whim. Unfortunately for them, the fish was only looking to get change for a dollar and is driven away by SpongeBob's excessive enthusiasm, though not before leaving a penny behind for SpongeBob. However, Mr. Krabs notices the penny and literally gets the drop on it first.\nAs Mr. Krabs stores the penny away in his vault, he gives his two employees the bad news: Profits are way down this month, and they need a gimmick to bring in customers. His request for ideas yields a response of apathy from Squidward and increasingly absurd ideas from SpongeBob. After Mr. Krabs points out that he was thinking along the lines of \"live entertainment,\" Squidward hits a brainstorm: the first Krusty Krab talent show, which he would host.\nHe nearly blurts out his intent to make himself into a star, but quickly corrects his faux-pas by claiming it would \"bring culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom,\" and that it would bring in much-needed revenue. Squidward draws in Mr. Krabs further by claiming that Pearl could become a star through this. SpongeBob is excited at the chance to show off his talents and runs off to call his parents, while Mr. Krabs gives Squidward approval to organize the show. As preparations are undertaken at the Krusty Krab for the upcoming show, SpongeBob asks Squidward when he is going to go on the show, even demonstrating his act, which consists of blowing a hippopotamus-shaped bubble, then tap dancing along with it. Unfortunately, the talent does not impress Squidward, who claims it is not \"cultured\" enough. SpongeBob runs off, vowing to come up with the most \"cultural\" performance ever.\nLater that evening, the Krusty Krab is packed; among the audience are Patrick and SpongeBob's parents, the latter of whom Mr. Krabs personally introduces himself and nonchalantly admits his miserhood. Backstage, Squidward makes it very clear to everyone else that this is his own chance to reach stardom, but is interrupted by SpongeBob's newest act: inflating himself with water and showing off his spongy characteristics. Squidward once again shoots him down, not wanting SpongeBob to ruin his chances at stardom. SpongeBob tearfully begs Squidward to let him on the show, claiming he will do anything, with the cephalopod assigning him to clean up after the show is done. SpongeBob, not realizing that Squidward has assigned him custodial duties, endeavors on his new \"act\" with great enthusiasm.\nSquidward goes on stage to introduce the audience to the first Krusty Krab Talent Show, in the process making a joke about how no one else would give the Krabby Patty a home. This greatly amuses Patrick to the point where he randomly interrupts the next parts of Squidward's speech with loud guffawing. Not able to get in a word edgewise, Squidward eventually just introduces Pearl by her name alone and leaves the stage. Pearl is unveiled with a set of cheerleader pom-poms, and Mr. Krabs is ecstatic to see his daughter in the spotlight. Her act is a cheerleading routine about the Krusty Krab, but her size and weight launch the entire audience up into the air with each jump, resulting in everyone eventually lying about in various states of pain. As she leaves the stage, SpongeBob drops into badger Squidward about his next \"act,\" asking which direction he should mop the floor, with the latter trying to ignore him.\nThe next act is poetry by SpongeBob's pet snail, Gary. While the pet \"speaks\" in meows, at least Sandy Cheeks can understand how good his poetry is. Squidward is increasingly anxious at this point, both from how much time Gary is taking with his act and from SpongeBob bothering him again. The third act is by Mr. Krabs' business rival Plankton as \"The Amazing Plankton,\" with him intending to make a Krabby Patty \"disappear\" before the audience's eyes. However, it is just another ploy to steal the Krabby Patty formula, one that Mr. Krabs puts a stop to. Plankton, vowing revenge, attempts to vanish into thin air with a magic spell, but only blows himself up and leaves the restaurant in shame as the crowd boos him.\nThe crowd by this point is getting fed up with the terrible acts, and Mr. Krabs storms backstage, angry at the lack of good responses. Squidward temporarily placates him by claiming he \"saved the best for last.\" After some buildup with spotlights, Squidward appears with his dancing gear, wearing a blue swimsuit, to looks of confusion from the audience.\nSquidward starts out dancing to orchestral music before the music suddenly changes into a trance-like techno beat; Squidward's dancing also becomes incredibly bizarre. Unfortunately for him, his time in the spotlight comes to an abrupt end as the audience members, completely disgusted by his talent, or lack thereof, pelt him with tomatoes from the free salad bar. Mr. Krabs, hoping to cash in on the audience's rage, quickly slaps a one-dollar price tag on the front of the free salad bar, which one audience member admits is \"worth every penny\" because they all hate Squidward's act more than all of the other acts put together. Squidward berates the audience for having no appreciation for his talent, only to be coldly rebuffed as the crowd says \"No Talent.\" Furious, he storms backstage, where a waiting SpongeBob asks whether he can go on now. Squidward permits him to do so, as the show is over, much to the sponge's confusion.\nSpongeBob gets to work cleaning the stage, only to receive an unexpected surprise: the audience not only interprets the cleaning as an act but appreciates it. Squidward thinks the audience has changed their mind about him and charges in as SpongeBob leaves, only to be met with silence. He storms off again, and SpongeBob continues cleaning to great applause. Squidward charges in and is once again met by silence. However, he begins to realize that SpongeBob seems to be tied to the audience's sudden change in behavior, and tries several times to get the audience to cheer for him by doing SpongeBob's act, only to be rejected and have another tomato thrown at him. Squidward is forced to conclude that it is SpongeBob the audience is cheering for and watches from the sidelines. Squidward gets praised by Mr. Krabs for organizing the event, and SpongeBob's parents for making their son a star. Mr. Krabs, lying in a wheelbarrow full of money, says he will need another one for next week's show; Squidward can only sigh and watch with sad envy as SpongeBob gets a standing ovation for his cleaning, ending the episode."}

Plankton, patty in tow, escapes outside by making a hole in the door with a laser.\nSpongeBob heroically chases after him. After a long chase across the cityscape, SpongeBob finally recovers the Krabby Patty and is congratulated by the townsfolk, while Plankton walks home downcast. SpongeBob, feeling sorry for Plankton, decides to befriend him.\nSpongeBob invites Plankton to go jellyfishing with him. Realizing he can take advantage of SpongeBob, Plankton goes. At Jellyfish Fields, Plankton remains fixated on evil and destruction, while SpongeBob tries to explain fun to him by singing the \"F.U.N. Song.\" Eventually, Plankton starts singing the song as well, first, he sings his own version with violent lyrics, but eventually, he sings SpongeBob's version and seems to finally be having fun. He seems to forget about stealing the formula and begins to develop a genuine sense of friendship.\nWhen Mr. Krabs sees this, he refuses to believe that Plankton has changed, and sets up a trap for them when he goes to the Krusty Krab to meet SpongeBob the next day. He attempts to tempt Plankton with a Krabby Patty, but Plankton sits motionless and apathetic with the patty in front of him. After SpongeBob and Plankton leave to go to the movies, Mr. Krabs begins to suspect that Plankton really has gone straight and nice, until he realizes that he actually did take the patty.\nAt the Reef Cinema, Mr. Krabs appears in front of the projector and demands everyone in the theater to reach into their friend or partner's pocket to see what they have got. SpongeBob reaches into Plankton's pocket and finds a Krabby Patty. SpongeBob realizes that Plankton used him to get a Krabby Patty. Plankton attempts to explain that he realizes now that he only ever wanted friendship, before admitting to everything and running off with the patty through the movie screen, tearing it in half in the process.\nSpongeBob believes Plankton won, but Mr. Krabs tells him he did not. He shows SpongeBob behind the screen, revealing Plankton to be badly squashed on a damaged concrete wall with the Patty. SpongeBob apologizes to Mr. Krabs and they decide to go back to the Krusty Krab and have a fresh Krabby Patty. Mr. Krabs flicks Plankton off the wall and onto Bubble Bass' hand, where he mistakes Plankton for a jelly bean. Bubble Bass chases Plankton around his hand with him screaming, concluding the episode."}
{"prompt": "MuscleBob BuffPants", "completion": "SpongeBob starts his day off by posing in front of a mirror as he gets ready to make himself \"large and wide.\" He goes to his stuffed animal barbell weights, and with great effort manages to lift them over his head before falling to the side. Just then, Sandy comes inside and SpongeBob shows off his stick arm \"muscles,\" bragging about his \"state of the art weight set.\" However, Sandy bluntly tells him that he is not going to gain any muscle mass lifting those. She then shows him her arms and asks if he wants arms like them. He then decides he could use some help and Sandy recommends he starts using her own personal training program. SpongeBob is ecstatic, imagining himself being big and muscular in various situations - flipping burgers, jellyfishing, and sleeping - with a bodybuilder's physique, and agrees to come to Sandy's treedome at 5 AM to begin his new workout.\nAt the treedome, SpongeBob is put through a progressively intense series of warm-up exercises from push-ups to boxing to running on a giant hamster wheel, each resulting in his arms separating from his body. Sandy now takes the less than enthusiastic sponge to the \"arm cruncher,\" to which the sight of the contraption drives SpongeBob away, only leaving a phone in Sandy's grasp. Back home, SpongeBob is despondent and in pain at how difficult working out actually is until a voice addresses him from the TV, calling him a wimp. It is a commercial for the Anchor Arms, a set of inflatable muscle balloons with options ranging from normal to \"veiny,\" and \"for the ladies... hairy!,\" with the shark demonstrating its uses. Gary meows skeptically, but SpongeBob is interested and goes to buy some.\nLater, while wearing the Anchor Arms, SpongeBob heads towards Mussel Beach, freaking out everyone else along the way. Once he gets there, everyone is awestruck by \"MuscleBob BuffPants,\" and follows him to the Juice Bar. Sandy comes along asking where SpongeBob is and finds him surrounded by his new fans. A short moment where SpongeBob cannot move his drink reveals the downside of his Anchor Arms: because the \"muscles\" are just air inside an arm-shaped balloon, he is still a weakling, but manages to avoid detection by sipping the straw from a distance. Sandy is naturally confused as to how he managed to gain muscles so quickly, to which SpongeBob replies that he found his own secret workout. Intrigued, Sandy asks what the secret was; putting SpongeBob on the spot as everyone else also wants to know.\nSpongeBob manages to fool them by claiming armpit farts are his secret workout, pushing aside skepticism by pointing out the results. Everyone else promptly begins armpit farting, while Sandy congratulates SpongeBob for finally finding a workout that works for him. To SpongeBob's surprise, she then suggests he needed to put those muscles to the test, and it just so happens the Anchor Toss Competition is today. Completely caught off guard, SpongeBob doesn't notice a drink being placed on top of his Anchor Arms and tries to tell Sandy he is not interested, but she decides to go sign them up anyway. Scared of being exposed, he tries to stop her but finds himself pressured down by the drink. The panicking SpongeBob finally catches up to Sandy after the waiter takes the drink off of his hand, sending him flying into the pole next to her. Unfortunately, Sandy has already signed them up, and there's no turning back.\nAt the Anchor Toss, everyone is preparing themselves, except for the worried and unsure SpongeBob. He nervously says he is ready when Sandy comes by to check, but quickly begins inflating more into his Anchor Arms in desperation when she turns away. Perch Perkins announces the start of the 8th Annual Anchor Toss Competition, with Don the Whale making the first toss. His anchor lands at 200 yards, with an \"instant replay\" crushing the helpless measurer. Next up is Larry the Lobster; the measurer, not wanting to be crushed again, tries to run out of firing range, but the anchor tracks him and crushes him at 210 yards. Sandy is up next, and launches her anchor with her signature karate kick; the measurer desperately tries to outrun the anchor but is hit at 510 yards, putting Sandy in the lead.\nIt's finally SpongeBob's turn, with the crowd chanting his name as they do his armpit farting workout. SpongeBob tries to lift the anchor, but only manages to pull it on top of himself. He manages to pass it off as a joke, but knows that he can't keep the charade up; he is going to be exposed as a phony. However, he decides he has to try anyway and blows his arms up to the \"jerk\" size, apparently breaking them. He puts all of his might into lifting the anchor, but all it does is push the air into various parts of his body and eventually the Anchor Arms explode out of overinflation, revealing SpongeBob to be a weak fraud. Upon realizing this, the crowd exclaims that he lost and start cheering for Sandy, since she won. Sandy herself is very disappointed in SpongeBob's revelation, tapping her feet expectantly; SpongeBob gets the hint, realizing there's no substitute for hard work and trudges after her.\nThe episode ends back at the treedome, as SpongeBob's new exercise is changing the TV channel 100 times with his thumb, much to his discomfort. Sandy figures they have finally found an exercise that works for him right before SpongeBob's arm falls off again, and he asks if she can pick it up."}
{"prompt": "Squidward the Unfriendly Ghost", "completion": "Squidward has just completed a wax sculpture of himself and declares that he has \"conquered all artistic media.\" He is annoyed by SpongeBob and Patrick, who are playing a loud game, and goes to take a bath. SpongeBob and Patrick begin playing catch with a shell, but it flies into Squidward's house and knocks over the wax sculpture. The two think they have injured Squidward, and after several attempts to \"resuscitate\" him, they believe that Squidward has perished.  \nHaving finished his bath, Squidward dramatically emerges from the bathroom in a rush of steam, wearing talcum powder and a white bathrobe. SpongeBob and Patrick believe that they are seeing Squidward's ghost, and, hoping to evade his \"ghostly anger,\" promise that they will do anything he says. Squidward, instead of telling them he is not dead, gleefully plays along in order to have them pamper him and do chores for him.\nWhen instructed to clean one of Squidward's rooms, SpongeBob and Patrick come across a comic book that contains the story of the Flying Dutchman. The story says that the Dutchman haunts the seas because his corpse was used as a window display in a store rather than being laid to rest. The two decide that since Squidward is a vengeful spirit, they must put him to rest. Despite Squidward's protests, SpongeBob and Patrick arrange for him to be buried and invite people over to mourn him. \nSquidward soon admits his charade, but SpongeBob and Patrick believe that Squidward is simply in denial about his death. SpongeBob blows a giant bubble that encapsulates Squidward and sends him floating right out of the water, up to \"the great beyond.\" Squidward is last seen high in the air and surrounded by seagulls, which only adds to his discomfort."}

Just then, Pearl runs in crying so profusely that her tears begin to literally flood the restaurant. Mr. Krabs asks her what is wrong, and she explains that her apparently \"long, tan, and handsome\" prom date has just dumped her the day before prom. Mr. Krabs offers to take her instead, but she starts crying, causing an earthquake. He then suggests she take Squidward or one of the restaurant's customers to the prom, but she continues crying, which causes the earthquake to become worse. Ultimately, he offers to have SpongeBob accompany her. Pearl does not want to be embarrassed by SpongeBob, and begs him to try his best to not do anything embarrassing.\nAt home, using a magazine Gary provides as a guide, SpongeBob dresses up and uses extremely long and unstable artificial legs to make himself look \"long, tan, and handsome\" for Pearl. On the night of the prom, things initially work well for SpongeBob and Pearl. However, SpongeBob's costume soon begins malfunctioning, resulting in disaster and severely embarrassing Pearl. SpongeBob, after having broken everything at the prom, runs into the ladies' restroom crying.\nPearl, feeling sorry for him, attempts to console him and restore his confidence. This ultimately succeeds, and Pearl and SpongeBob join the prom dance. They begin doing a dance called \"Doing the Sponge,\" which everyone else soon begins doing. However, this results in many injuries and mass destruction. An angry mob forms and lifts up Pearl and SpongeBob, who think they are popular enough to be lifted as until the mob throws them out of the building.\nSpongeBob apologizes, but Pearl tells him not to worry as she knew it was going to be a total disaster the whole time and even though it was a disaster, it was really fun. Mr. Krabs opens the door with a rake saying \"Keep away from me flower!\" Pearl thinks he is talking about her, but Mr. Krabs really meant a literal flower on the walkway. Pearl says goodnight to SpongeBob as she returns home, and tries to get SpongeBob's attention, but as she does so, SpongeBob appears to be frozen.\nMr. Krabs congratulates SpongeBob on his success at the prom, then goes in his house and closes the door, then the real SpongeBob appears to retrieve his wax dummy of himself, and carries it off, laughing as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Employee of the Month", "completion": "SpongeBob reminds Squidward that the Krusty Krab's Employee of the Month Award is about to be granted. Squidward tells SpongeBob that the award is nothing but a scam, and that Mr. Krabs only gives it out to make them work harder for less money. SpongeBob does not believe him and insists Squidward should take more pride in his work, but when Mr. Krabs warn hi that Squidward might win the award, SpongeBob begins to worry. \nSpongeBob tries to work harder in the kitchen, starting with cooking and flipping Krabby Patties twice as fast as he normally does. While attempting to flip one patty that is somehow stuck to the grill, he to sends it flying, and it gets stuck to the ceiling. As SpongeBob tries to pry the patty off the ceiling, Squidward comes in to the kitchen. Squidward, seeing SpongeBob is continuing to exert himself, tells him that he has lost his mind over the award and continues to claim that the award is a scam.\nLater, SpongeBob starts to question himself regarding the award, worrying that Squidward is right, and that the award is a scam. Suddenly, he imagines the photos on his previous awards as drill sergeants, and the one for March tells him Squidward is only telling him the award is a scam so he will lose confidence in himself. The March picture \"convinces\" SpongeBob to fight back, and SpongeBob prepares to outpace Squidward.\nThat night, SpongeBob sneaks into Squidward's house and tries to destroy his alarm clock so that Squidward will not wake up. Squidward catches him in the act, leading to an argument concerning the award. Squidward says that he could get the award if he wanted to, and SpongeBob demands him to prove it. As SpongeBob leaves, they both decide that they will arrive at the Krusty Krab earlier than the other.\nSpongeBob and Squidward glare at each other from their own houses to make sure that the other does not leave before them. Squidward plays a lullaby for SpongeBob with his clarinet to put him to sleep. Squidward then tries to sneak over to the Krusty Krab while SpongeBob is asleep, but trips and falls into a deep hole that SpongeBob dug in front of Squidward's door. SpongeBob confronts Squidward, and then antagonizes him by leaving him in the hole. As SpongeBob goes back home, Squidward climbs out of the hole himself. Then Squidward tries to barricade SpongeBob's front door with some wood and nails, only to have SpongeBob saw the door down from the inside. They both make a desperate run for the Krusty Krab and set several traps for each other along the way.\nThe next morning, SpongeBob and Squidward have somehow gotten to the point of dragging an anchor and a galley respectively. They get tired and call a truce with each other, only to break it as soon as they finish shaking hands, and continue the run. They both get there at the same time, just as Mr. Krabs opens the doors. They begin overworking in an attempt to impress him, doing more harm than good, destroying much of the restaurants' supplies, and scaring Mr. Krabs out of his wits in the process.\nThen, they begin trying to make as many Krabby Patties as possible. The number of patties gets so high that it causes the Krusty Krab to explode. As the patties rain down from the sky, some of the Bikini Bottomites believe they are free. As Mr. Krabs, stuck in the wall where the Employee of the Month placards are displayed, tries to make the customers pay for them, SpongeBob and Squidward eagerly ask him who the winner is, giving him a headache and ending the episode."}
{"prompt": "Scaredy Pants", "completion": "As the episode begins on the evening of Halloween in Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob is cleaning the dishes at the Krusty Krab at the end of the workday. He becomes frightened by the door suddenly closing and a message reading \"BOO\" written on order slips.\nAfter he finishes, he begins to run away, but Mr. Krabs stops him and asks him if he wants to hear his \"annual scary story,\" and he then does. Mr. Krabs tells the story of \"The Flying Dutchman,\" a ghost who steals souls on Halloween. Squidward, dressed up like the Flying Dutchman, appears behind SpongeBob, saying that he will steal his soul, terrifying him. SpongeBob, who has a reputation for being easily scared, is then nicknamed \"SpongeBob ScaredyPants,\" rushes home, and is scared by everything he sees on the way.\nAfter being accidentally scared by Patrick wearing Groucho Marx glasses, he asks him for help. They make a \"Flying Dutchman\" costume, but it fails to scare anyone. SpongeBob realizes that a \"real\" ghost has a round head and that he has a square one. Patrick shaves SpongeBob's head, making it round. Believing themselves to be scary, SpongeBob and Patrick go around town attempting to scare people, and believe themselves to be successful in doing so, although their \"victims\" are simply confused by their antics.\nThen, they go to the roof of the Krusty Krab, where a Halloween party is taking place. They turn off all the lights in the building and Patrick lowers SpongeBob in with a rope while providing the voice of the \"Dutchman,\" which initially terrifies everyone. However, when a jellyfish stings Patrick, whom the rope is tied to, he starts running around in pain, causing SpongeBob to fly around uncontrollably, exposing his true identity.\nEverybody starts laughing at SpongeBob, but soon the real Flying Dutchman appears. He explains to them how offended he is by people dressing up as him for Halloween, and that SpongeBob's costume is the worst of all. Before he is about to steal the souls of everyone present, the Flying Dutchman first takes off SpongeBob's costume, which reveals that his brain is almost completely exposed as a result of Patrick's shaving.\nThe Dutchman flees in terror. Subsequently, everyone runs away from the Krusty Krab screaming, leaving SpongeBob satisfied to finally have succeeded in scaring people. Patrick comments on SpongeBob's \"pink hat,\" and SpongeBob explains that it is not a hat, but rather his brain. Patrick also screams and runs away. SpongeBob ends the episode reassuring Patrick that his skin will grow back."}
{"prompt": "I Was a Teenage Gary", "completion": "SpongeBob is playing with Gary when Patrick comes and tells him about the Jellyfishing Convention in Ukulele Bottom that weekend. Realizing that he will not be able to take Gary, SpongeBob asks Squidward to look after the snail while he is away. SpongeBob takes Squidward around his house, telling him that he will have to feed Gary for three days. There are very large cans of snail food with the words \"morning\" and \"night\" written on them so that Squidward will be able to keep track. Eager to get rid of both of them, Squidward lies and says that he will do it to get SpongeBob and Patrick to leave. Finally they do, and Squidward runs out of SpongeBob's house and sits in a lounge chair to sunbathe for the whole weekend, thus ignoring Gary. He soaks up plenty of sun, but Gary is left in the house, looking longingly in the direction where SpongeBob left, horribly neglected.\nWhen SpongeBob gets back, Squidward suddenly remembers that he was supposed to take care of Gary. However, when he goes to get to the snail, he finds him very sick, due to lack of food, water, and attention. Squidward, thinking he will be able to help, tries to give Gary some food. However, Gary is so weak from waiting for SpongeBob to come home, he is limp in Squidward's arms and will not eat. Squidward puts Gary down as he hears SpongeBob and Patrick saying goodbye to each other and tries to force feed Gary. When he hears SpongeBob coming in, Squidward gives up and puts all of Gary's food into his mouth. He greets SpongeBob awkwardly and explains that he was only checking on Gary.\nJust as Squidward is about to leave with a smirk on his face, Gary slowly enters the room. SpongeBob realizes that something is wrong, and quickly calls the local veterinarian, Dr. Gill Gilliam. The vet comes over to SpongeBob's house and concludes that a syringe full of snail plasma must be administered to Gary; Dr. Gilliam leaves SpongeBob with the syringe, claiming that he is too squeamish to perform the injection himself. SpongeBob asks Squidward to give Gary the plasma, as he too is squeamish, and Squidward reluctantly agrees. However, an anxious SpongeBob constantly moves Gary around instead of holding him still, fearing that Squidward's attempts to inject the plasma in a quick stabbing motion will hurt Gary. In the commotion, Squidward accidentally injects SpongeBob with the plasma, causing SpongeBob to worry about the consequences; Squidward tells him not to worry.\nAs the two argue, Gary goes to take a drink of water and immediately feels better. Annoyed, Squidward leaves, insisting to SpongeBob that nothing will happen. Sometime later, SpongeBob starts acting slow and somewhat like a snail, as well as eating Gary's food himself after SpongeBob thinks that he is fine like Squidward had said. When he goes to the bathroom, his eyes stretch out of his body and grow, his body becomes flat to the ground, his arms and legs disappear into his body, his body reshapes itself, and he also loses the ability to talk after saying \"Something is wrong with meeeeeeeeeow!\" As a finished result, SpongeBob has turned into a snail.\nAfterwards, he goes over to Squidward's house to get help, but Squidward is terrified of the fact that SpongeBob turned into a snail because of his lousy aim, and he throws the snail plasma away and he tries to reassure himself. He hears SpongeBob at the door and starts blocking the doors and windows and tries to run and hide from SpongeBob as he realizes that he should have taken care of Gary and none of this would ever have happened if he had. SpongeBob chases him for help, but Squidward keeps running, thinking he is under attack, and ultimately makes a mess of his house. Amongst the chaos, Squidward accidentally injects himself with the plasma, turning him into a snail as well, ironically getting his well-deserved punishment for his gross negligence towards Gary.\nThe ending has Gary, SpongeBob, and Squidward meowing to the tune of \"Blow the Man Down\" on top of a fence. Patrick, who has been awakened and annoyed by this, yells at them to clam up and throws a boot at Squidward, knocking him off the fence while the screen fades to black."}
{"prompt": "SB-129", "completion": "Early one Sunday morning, Squidward goes to his window to play his clarinet. However, SpongeBob's alarm clock goes off at the same time, jamming Squidward's clarinet in his throat. SpongeBob asks Squidward if he'd like to go jellyfishing, taking Squidward's squeals of protest as a \"yes.\" After dislodging the clarinet from his throat, Squidward finds SpongeBob and Patrick waiting for him. When he refuses to come out, Patrick realizes he doesn't want to play with them, but SpongeBob believes it is because he is still preparing to play with them and repeatedly asks him if he is ready.\nSquidward asks SpongeBob why he is not at work, to which SpongeBob replies that the Krusty Krab is closed on Sundays. Squidward tells them to wait for him, closes the door, then sneaks out the back and heads for the Krusty Krab. It is indeed deserted, but SpongeBob and Patrick soon arrive calling for Squidward. He runs to the kitchen and hides in the storage freezer. When SpongeBob and Patrick cannot find him, they assume he is already at Jellyfish Fields and leave. Squidward tries to exit the freezer but finds that the door is locked; he assures himself that someone will find him soon enough.\n2,000 years later, Squidward is still stuck in the freezer, frozen in a block of ice. The door's rusted hinges give way and Squidward falls to the floor. SpongeTron, a robotic descendant of SpongeBob, sees the frozen cephalopod and thaws him out. Squidward is shocked to discover that he is in the future and begs for a way to get back to his own time, so SpongeTron directs him to a time machine. Squidward decides that he will travel to a time before SpongeBob has born, simply referred to as \"the past.\" \nThe time machine arrives in the primordial sea. Squidward hopes that he can finally play his clarinet in peace, but he soon runs into a primitive sponge and starfish. The two remain curious about Squidward, but are soon distracted by a jellyfish, which they are frightened of. Taking his chance to get away, Squidward tries to play once more but is constantly interrupted by the screams of the primitives, who are zapping themselves with the jellyfish. Squidward has them tear pieces off their loincloths and proceeds to fashion jellyfish nets for them. Amazed by Squidward's demonstration of jellyfishing, the primitives take the nets in earnest.\nSquidward begins to play at last. However, the wailing of the clarinet aggravates the primitives and they chase him down. Barely making it back to the time machine, Squidward frantically jams the lever up and down and accidentally snaps it off, sending the machine hurtling through time and space before arriving in a world of emptiness.\nSquidward is glad to have found a place where he can be alone, but hearing several disembodied voices repeating the word \"alone,\" prove too much for him to bear. He frantically tries and fails to escape (repeatedly coming back to the same spot where he started). Desperate, he stomps on the ground in frustration and crashes through the floor and back into the time machine. Squidward breaks down sobbing and begs the time machine to take him home, saying that he even misses SpongeBob.\nAt his words, the time machine returns Squidward to Conch Street, where SpongeBob and Patrick await him. When they ask him if he is finally ready for jellyfishing, Squidward refuses and demands to know who invented such a foolish game. They remind him that it was, in fact, he who invented it, and Squidward, realizing he has inadvertently caused a temporal paradox, states that he is going back to rectify his mistake."}
{"prompt": "Karate Choppers", "completion": "SpongeBob and Sandy are practicing karate against each other. After fighting in SpongeBob's house, Sandy tells him that she will sneak up on him and fight him tomorrow. At the Barg'N-Mart, their battle continues. Later, Sandy pulls out SpongeBob's tongue and grabs a bottle of Volcano Sauce to have him surrender. SpongeBob imagines a face on the drop of hot sauce and quickly gives up. At the Krusty Krab the next day, SpongeBob thinks anyone or anything can be Sandy, so he is cautious and does not work much. When SpongeBob attacks one of the customers, Mr. Krabs demands to know what is going on, so SpongeBob explains to him that he is doing karate.\nEventually, Mr. Krabs tells him to stop doing karate or he will be fired. Later, Sandy appears and attacks SpongeBob, although he tries to explain Mr. Krabs' warning to her, she thinks he is bluffing and does not listen. Mr. Krabs witnesses them and fires SpongeBob, who cries and runs around the place crazily. Feeling guilty, Sandy explains that it was her fault and begs Mr. Krabs to give SpongeBob his job back. Mr. Krabs agrees on the condition that they do no more karate, saying it is poisoning SpongeBob's mind.\nThe two try to forget about karate and go to Seashell Park for a picnic. However, everything reminds them of karate, particularly when SpongeBob slices bologna using karate chops. They eventually can't resist the urge and slice up all kinds of ingredients and make several sandwiches in the process. They eventually take up karate again and have a great deal of fun.\nMr. Krabs, who is taking a walk in the park, catches them surrounded by sandwiches and the surroundings are really trashed, clearly having broken their promise. SpongeBob admits the truth, saying he cannot help himself and asks Mr. Krabs to simply fire him. However, Mr. Krabs replies that he has something else in mind.\nBack at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs rehires SpongeBob along with Sandy make Krabby Patties at an exceptional rate, using karate chops to slice and assemble the ingredients, which brings in lots of customers and makes Mr. Krabs twice as much money as before."}
{"prompt": "Sleepy Time", "completion": "After settling for bed in the evening and sleeping, SpongeBob has a strange dream where he is driving a hot rod in a Krabby Patty-themed location and he has his driver's license, then crashes into a rock. However, Mrs. Puff appears and tears up SpongeBob's license, and he is then propelled out of his own dream. He appears as a small, glowing version of himself in the outside world, where he sees himself sleeping. SpongeBob realizes that he has no dream to go to, until he sees Gary's dream cloud. He then jumps in, frightening Gary.\nIn his dream, Gary has a humanoid body who can speak English and resides in a huge library. Gary tells SpongeBob some limericks before SpongeBob goes out of Gary's dream cloud and into Patrick's. Patrick's dream is completely empty, except for a kiddy ride that he is riding on and a door resembling that of SpongeBob's front door that leads out of the dream. SpongeBob explains to him that in a dream, he can do whatever he wants, which he demonstrates by changing size and creating a million copies of himself. Patrick says he's already satisfied, and SpongeBob goes out of Patrick's dream cloud. The ride then stops and Patrick takes out a quarter but drops it in a sewer grid.\nNext, he goes into Squidward's dream, where Squidward is playing his clarinet for a king in a theater. SpongeBob distracts the king by telling him a limerick that Gary recited in his dream, and Squidward stops, mad at SpongeBob for invading his dream. The king growls at him for not playing. After this happens several times, Squidward becomes so angry that he snaps his clarinet, but SpongeBob saves him by turning into a clarinet. It produces no sound, and SpongeBob just sings horribly, which surprisingly everybody applauds at. A crowd then picks up SpongeBob while throwing Squidward into a fruit cart, wondering how he can make such music. He then transforms back into his normal form and runs out the exit doors at the back of the theater. Squidward is knocked into the fruit cart by the audience and the king while they chase SpongeBob as he exits the dream.\nSpongeBob goes into Sandy's dream, where they are skydiving and have to land on a painted target. SpongeBob asks if it's \"kind of dangerous,\" and Sandy says \"Not as long as you got a big ol' parachute.\" SpongeBob misunderstands her twice (such perceiving \"pair of shoes\" and \"parakeet\"), and while trying to explain to him, Sandy fails to open her own parachute in time and lands in a truck filled with clam manure. SpongeBob falls out of Sandy's dream and says to himself \"All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams.\"\nHowever, he then goes to what he thinks is Mr. Krabs' dream, but actually is Pearl's dream, where she is having a tea party with her stuffed animals in a very childish and girlish setting. After realizing this, he immediately goes to Mr. Krabs' dream, where he's fishing for money. Mr. Krabs instructs SpongeBob to pull out his money net from his back pocket, which turns out to be Mr. Krabs' wallet. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs manage to catch Moby dollar, but it escapes and Mr. Krabs shoots SpongeBob out of the dream via a harpoon gun tied to SpongeBob.\nHe is launched directly into Plankton's dream. Plankton, in his dream, is a giant monster and can shoot lasers from his eye, and is destroying the city. SpongeBob realizes that it isn't a dream, but a nightmare. Once Gary is about to be crushed by Plankton, SpongeBob pricks his foot by turning into a pushpin, and Plankton deflates. The angry Bikini Bottomites close in on him and Plankton tells them that he guesses he has some explaining to do, but gets his punishment by being stepped on by everyone else. Plankton then wakes up in terror.\nSpongeBob then goes back to his own dream cloud, where the angry faces of everyone whose dreams he entered appear around him. When he wakes up, everyone (except Patrick) is in his house complaining that he's messed up their dreams and tells him to stay out. Just before the episode ends, Patrick then appears out of nowhere and asks everyone if they have a quarter, and they stare at Patrick in confusion."}
{"prompt": "Suds", "completion": "One night, SpongeBob has a dream about it raining Krabby Patties and realizes he is hungry. He gets up to make himself a Sea-Nut Butter and jellyfish jelly sandwich, but falls asleep after the first bite and leaves the refrigerator open, causing his entire house to freeze overweight. By morning, he develops the suds, an illness that causes him to sneeze bubbles. SpongeBob goes to work in spite of his illness, but Mr. Krabs learns from Gary that SpongeBob has the suds and orders his fry cook to go home and get some rest.\nBack at home, SpongeBob decides he needs help and calls upon Sandy to take him to the doctor. Shortly after, he is visited by Patrick, who gives him a third-hand account of the doctor's office, describing it as a horrible place full of torture devices and old magazines. Terrified, SpongeBob asks Patrick to be his doctor instead. \"Doctor\" Patrick begins to practice on him, starting by plugging up all of SpongeBob's holes so bubbles will no longer come out. However, this causes SpongeBob to inflate every time he sneezes. SpongeBob thinks this \"treatment\" is helping (when it is attacking symptoms rather than the underlying condition, perhaps making it worse), to Patrick's joy. With this SpongeBob decides to call Sandy and tell her not to come, but his fingers are too big and puffy for the buttons. He then asks Patrick to call Sandy and tell her not to come. He does so, but Sandy does not think Patrick's \"care\" is effective and continues coming. Patrick then tells SpongeBob to hurry up and feel better or else Sandy will take him to the doctor. He tries several ineffective \"cures\" to SpongeBob's suds, including turning his foot into a seanut butter sandwich, yanking a tooth out, bouncing on him like a trampoline, repeatedly placing and removing a large band-aid and even drawing and quartering, by which time Sandy has arrived. SpongeBob sneezes one more time, this time turning him into a perfectly round ball.\nSandy demands Patrick open the door, but Patrick rolls SpongeBob out the back door and disguises the patient as a duplicate of his house. Sandy questions Patrick as to why he suddenly has two houses. Patrick replies that he has too much stuff for one. She then questions why his \"second house\" has feet, Patrick responding that it is his \"mobile home.\" SpongeBob then sneezes again, revealing himself. Patrick claim the \"dirt therapy\" is working just fine. Sandy says that he has to see a real doctor, but Patrick refuses, telling SpongeBob to \"say \"ahh\" to show Sandy he is fine but, when SpongeBob does so, his breath damages a small ecosystem, which shows Sandy that he is even worse than she thought. Sandy takes this as proof that SpongeBob needs to go to a doctor. Sandy and Patrick then squabble over SpongeBob and accidentally fling him into the air.\nPatrick asserts that everything was fine before Sandy arrived; Sandy retorts that he should be arrested for impersonating a doctor (and lying to his best friend). SpongeBob, meanwhile, bounces away and at the last second, comes to a stop in front of the Krusty Krab. Soon enough, the pressure from his plugged-up holes reaches a tipping point, and he sneezes violently, blasting the corks out of his holes and releasing a massive amount of bubbles, destroying the Krusty Krab, much to Mr. Krabs' annoyance.\nSandy then takes SpongeBob to a real doctor, who prescribes the \"sponge treatment,\" which is performed by a live human hand named Hans. This involves being rinsed with soap and used to scrub various objects and people, much to SpongeBob's delight. As Hans brings SpongeBob back to the clinic, the treatment cures him completely. SpongeBob exclaims that he loves the doctor, and he even receives a giant lollipop. Wanting a giant lollipop too, Patrick lies that he also has the suds, after blowing a bubble to prove it. The doctor's not fooled and he sarcastically assures \"Doctor Patrick\" that a \"special treatment\" awaits him. Hans returns, puts soap on Patrick, and uses him to clean a cactus and then a toilet, as punishment for lying to SpongeBob about the doctor being horrible and making SpongeBob's illness worse by impersonating a doctor. Patrick cries out, \"Wait, this doesn't seem right!\" as the screen fades to black, ending the episode."}

He is also working with Sandy to give Patrick a very special present - a hot-air balloon made of chocolate. SpongeBob tells Patrick he has a present prepared for him and Patrick is desperate to know what it is, but SpongeBob will not tell him to avoid ruining the surprise before Sandy arrives with it.\nSpongeBob takes Patrick to a Valentine's Day Carnival and Patrick thinks that this is the present, only to realize that it is not. As he tries to figure out what the present is, SpongeBob calls Sandy, who is flying the chocolate balloon to the carnival, and tells her about his curiousness. Unfortunately, a group of ferocious scallops attack her and she tells SpongeBob that she is going to be a little late. She tells him to bring Patrick up to the Ferris wheel and that she will meet him there.\nSpongeBob tells Patrick his present is on the Ferris wheel, and they position themselves at the top as planned. But Sandy is still not here yet so SpongeBob calls her; meanwhile at that moment, the scallops cause the balloon to lose air and derail her off-course, so she tells SpongeBob to switch to plan B. Therefore, Patrick's present is limited to a \"friendly handshake,\" and he is grumpy for the rest of the day at the carnival. Later, the two are sitting on a bench, when everybody thanks SpongeBob for giving them presents. Consumed by anger and jealousy, Patrick goes berserk and wreaks havoc across the carnival.\nHe ends up cornering several citizens, including a frightened SpongeBob, at a dead-end at the Goo Lagoon dock. Just as he is about to attack everybody, Sandy comes down just in time with the repaired chocolate balloon, having gotten the scallops to help her bring it to him. SpongeBob and the citizens desperately tell Patrick to turn around, but he does not budge. When Sandy greets him, he finally turns around and notices the chocolate balloon. He gets excited and jumps on the balloon, only to pop it when he eats it as it was a bubble. As the episode ends, Patrick gently tells SpongeBob that he didn't have to get him anything."}
{"prompt": "The Paper", "completion": "As the episode begins, Squidward comes outside to start his relaxing day. He begins it by chewing bubble gum while laying in his lawn chair, and tosses the wrapper into SpongeBob's front yard. SpongeBob comes outside of his house as well, only to realize that Squidward has dropped his wrapper on SpongeBob's yard. As Squidward is about to leave at the sight of SpongeBob, the latter catches him on time to ask if he wants it back. Squidward thinks it is only garbage, but SpongeBob states that in the right hands, it can be a goldmine of entertainment. Squidward does not believe SpongeBob and walks inside his house. SpongeBob asks him again if he wants it back, but he still refuses to keep it and tells SpongeBob he can have it.\nWith a sigh of relief, Squidward answers his ringing phone. When he answers it, it is actually SpongeBob asking if he is sure. Squidward angrily says that he is and that SpongeBob can keep it forever. Squidward hangs up the phone by slamming it, and starts panting from exhaustion. SpongeBob pops up from under the table the phone was on and asks Squidward if he is really sure. Squidward tells him to get out of his house and finally pushes him out. SpongeBob says it is his last time to change his mind, and Squidward tells SpongeBob one last time that he can keep it no matter how much he begs, pleads, or cries to have it back. After Squidward is out of SpongeBob's sight, SpongeBob says to the paper that he is lucky to have a friend like Squidward.\nSquidward is back inside his house to continue his planned, relaxing day. He hears SpongeBob's obnoxious laughter and begins to play his clarinet. He still hears SpongeBob's laughing and opens his window to ask SpongeBob what he is giggling about. SpongeBob apologizes and says that he is thinking about all the fun he is going to have with the paper. Squidward goes back to his clarinet, wondering how anyone can have fun with a piece of paper. He starts to play his clarinet again, but is interrupted by SpongeBob's laughing.\nSquidward gets very angry and opens his window again to see SpongeBob frolicking with the paper and showing Gary what fun things he can do with it. He pretends he is SuperSponge and uses the paper as his cape. Then he pretends to be SpongeBob JunglePants and swings on vines while he does a Tarzan yell with the paper covering his crotch area. He lands on his house, starts grunting, and says he will call his animal friends by making different animal noises. Gary meows and SpongeBob says that Gary is right and that he is not a jungle boy. Afterwards, SpongeBob jumps off of the roof of his house, saying that he is a box of army supplies, and uses the paper as a parachute. Next, he pretends to be a bull fighter with the paper being the blanket and having Gary as the bull.\nSpongeBob then does impressions. He does a guy with a mustache, a pirate with an eye patch, and a regular guy with an eye patch. He then starts to suck the paper in through his holes and blow it back out repeatedly. Squidward wonders how he does this and SpongeBob is shown making origami by swishing the paper around in his mouth. He makes a bird, a snowflake, and paper dolls. Squidward says that the paper does look like fun, but then covers his mouth, asking himself what he is saying. He storms back inside and says that the paper is not fun, but reading Boring Science digest is, and starts to read it. He is interrupted by SpongeBob laughing again. Squidward, while taking a bath, talking about how it is fun, but the paper then comes around the tub as an airplane with SpongeBob making the engine and gun noises. Then, Squidward is painting fruit and thinks that nothing is more fun than painting fruit. Squidward paints vigorously until he realizes he just painted himself playing with the paper and destroys the painting in rage. Squidward says to himself that he will prove to SpongeBob that the paper is not fun.\nSquidward walks fast outside of his house to play with a paddle ball. SpongeBob also uses the paper as a paddle ball, making Squidward feel dumb. He then gets SpongeBob's attention by playing with a Mini Squidward dummy. SpongeBob also does a dummy with the paper and everyone in Bikini Bottom laughs at the joke. Squidward rides in his shell car, saying that it's fun, and asks SpongeBob if the paper can do that. SpongeBob hovers above Squidward with the paper acting as a helicopter, replying \"no.\" Squidward then asks SpongeBob if the paper can play music and starts to play his clarinet. He plays \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" but with all of the wrong notes. SpongeBob says that he made it sound original, and corrects Squidward by playing a jazz version of it on the paper.\nSquidward demands SpongeBob to give him back his paper, but SpongeBob reminds Squidward that he told him to never give it back to him, no matter how much he begs, pleads, or cries. Squidward suggests that he could trade for something and offers a rubber band. SpongeBob almost trades, but says that Squidward is just testing him and that he will never give the paper to him. He then trades every possession he has, even his house, for the paper. SpongeBob still tries to keep his promise, until Squidward offers his shirt. He accepts the trade and gives Squidward the paper. Squidward is happy at first, but when he starts to try to do the other things that SpongeBob was doing with it, he has no fun whatsoever with it. Squidward realizes that the paper was not fun, SpongeBob just made it look fun because of how creative and optimistic he is. And since Squidward, who only wanted the paper to be better than SpongeBob, is not creative or optimistic, he cannot do all the things with the paper that SpongeBob could.\nThe episode ends with Squidward lamenting that he gave away all his possessions for a useless piece of paper. Patrick, who is casually walking by, takes the paper from Squidward and uses it as a disposable wrapper for his gum, leaving Squidward with nothing as he asks for sunscreen."}
{"prompt": "Arrgh!", "completion": "The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. It's a very slow day with no customers and Mr. Krabs is not pleased with the emptiness. However, SpongeBob is heard shouting his possession of eight gold doubloons. Upon hearing this, Mr. Krabs jumps over to SpongeBob to take the supposed coins for himself. SpongeBob explains to him that he and Patrick are merely playing a board game called The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt, which is based on a real treasure map.\nMr. Krabs sits down to play with them and wins the game. He instantly becomes addicted, even throwing a potential paying customer out and calling the restaurant closed as he continues to play with them, winning 17 times in a row. They play until late at night, when Patrick is passed out and a tired SpongeBob wants to go to bed. SpongeBob goes home, but finds Mr. Krabs there. Despite Mr. Krabs' attempts to persuade him to play more, SpongeBob soon shouts that he wants to sleep, but apologizes as he tells his boss it's only a game. Disappointed, Mr. Krabs stops and realizes he got carried away and leaves, apologizing for his behavior.\nThe following morning, SpongeBob wakes up to hear Mr. Krabs' voice and finds him in a pirate ship outside his house. Mr. Krabs tells him that they're going to be real pirates and go on a real treasure hunt, as Patrick appears to eagerly join them. However, the two struggle to learn how to act like \"real\" pirates and end up causing the ship to crash. The trio is forced to continue on foot, following instructions from the map, read by Mr. Krabs, who also tells them that they're not allowed to look at the map. Eventually, the map tells them to go 10,000 paces east from the seaweed with two leaves on it, and Mr. Krabs asks Patrick which way east is. He looks at a compass and points west. After walking 10,000 paces west, they realize that they have taken the wrong direction because Patrick thought Mr. Krabs said, \"weast,\" and begin walking back.\nAfter going around 9,552 paces east, they're exhausted and set up a camp to stay for the night. While trying to fall asleep, SpongeBob and Patrick get excited and find Mr. Krabs gone and the map all alone. They decide to look at the map but when they open it, they realize that it's actually their board game taped to a piece of paper. Mr. Krabs catches them, and they beg for mercy outside. However, his anger is forgotten when they realize that they're standing directly on top of the \"X\" that marks the spot and start digging. SpongeBob and Patrick use their hands to dig instead of shovels before they find the treasure, and SpongeBob and Patrick ask each other what they will do with their shares.\nUpon hearing this, Mr. Krabs greedily says that, since he is the captain, all of the treasure belongs to him. SpongeBob and Patrick get angry and state they deserve a share, since they found it. The trio begins fighting over the chest, as their arguing wakes up the Flying Dutchman, who appears and questions who dug up his loot. Scared, Mr. Krabs quickly blames SpongeBob and Patrick, the Dutchman questions this and they nervously confirm it. The ghost pirate congratulates SpongeBob and Patrick for saving him a lot of digging. He takes the treasure, and gives them two gold coins as a reward, to their joy. Angry, Mr. Krabs asks for a reward, but only receives a tiny plastic treasure chest, which the Dutchman explains is \"based on a real treasure chest!\" as he disappears, laughing maniacally.\nAfter he leaves, Patrick remarks Mr. Krabs looks sweaty again, somewhat hinting that he now wants revenge on the Dutchman for taking back his treasure while the episode concludes."}
{"prompt": "Rock Bottom", "completion": "As the episode begins, SpongeBob and Patrick board a bus in order to get home from Glove World!, a glove-themed amusement park that they enjoy. They accidentally board the wrong bus, which then takes them down a cliff. The cliff leads to a sort of aphotic zone called Rock Bottom, inhabited by multiple unusual and strange deep-sea animals. SpongeBob tells Patrick to wait while he goes to try and find a bus schedule. While SpongeBob is gone searching, Patrick gets on the bus to go home but accidentally leaves SpongeBob behind. SpongeBob tries to find a bus that will take him home but nothing happens.\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts to get on a bus, SpongeBob heads to the bus station and waits in a very long line. By the time he gets to the front, he finds out that the last bus to Bikini Bottom will leave in a few seconds, but before he has time to react, it pulls away from the station.\nThe Ticketmaster tells SpongeBob that that was the last bus until morning and leaves for the night, shutting off the lights in the process. SpongeBob, who is starting to show fear, takes out his glove flashlight, but the battery shorts out, leaving him in \"advanced darkness.\" As he stands alone in the station giving himself a pep-talk, he hears the familiar raspberry sound echoing and makes a mad dash back to the cliff. The raspberry sound is getting closer, and SpongeBob cowers in fear, yelling out a weak threat. As the creature closes in, a bright light engulfs SpongeBob, and he lets out a scream. He is relieved when he noticed the light is coming from a friendly-looking anglerfish creature who found SpongeBob's lost glove balloon. SpongeBob sarcastically thanks him for solving the balloon problem but begins rambling about his other problem: trying to get home. The anglerfish blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist. SpongeBob makes another sarcastic comment about how the balloon already has enough air while closing his eyes and blowing raspberries. He opens his eyes to see he is floating in the air and understands the anglerfish was helping him using the unorthodox method of balloon travel. He thanks the anglerfish for his help, who replies with a polite \"you're welcome\" and waves goodbye.\nSpongeBob is able to take the currents back to Bikini Bottom and directly to the front of his house. After he lands the balloon pops and the episode ends with Patrick, riding on a bus back to Rock Bottom thinking SpongeBob is still stuck there."}
{"prompt": "Texas", "completion": "The episode starts up at Goo Lagoon where SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy are playing in the sand. Sandy makes some sand in the shape of Texas, which is soon destroyed by the goo tide. She walks off sadly, while SpongeBob tries to cheer her up and offers to play with her, but Sandy explains that she is just feeling a little homesick. SpongeBob and Patrick then blindfold her and take her to her treedome, which only adds to Sandy's depression. She begins crying, and runs off.\nBoth SpongeBob and Patrick are confused until they hear Sandy singing a song from on top of her treedome about how much she misses Texas. They decide to cheer up Sandy by throwing a Texas-themed party for her at the Krusty Krab. They go to Sandy's house to ask her to come to the Krusty Krab with them, but she tells them that she is leaving Bikini Bottom to move back to Texas. SpongeBob is shocked by this, and tries to convince her to go to the Krusty Krab, but fails. Sandy gets into a bus out of Bikini Bottom and leaves. Patrick insults Texas by calling it dumb, asking what is so great about it.\nSuddenly, the bus comes back and Sandy returns, and she angrily berates Patrick for badmouthing her hometown. Patrick then asks if he can say that people from Texas are dumb, which angers her even further. This gives SpongeBob an idea to lure Sandy to the Krusty Krab. He and Patrick continue insulting Texas, and Sandy begins chasing them. They intend to lead Sandy to her surprise party at the Krusty Krab. Patrick continuously insults Texas, thinking Sandy is too slow to catch up to them, only to soon realize that she is very fast and catching up to them.\nSandy lassos Patrick and pulls him to her, and a nuclear explosion is shown in the background as he disappears. SpongeBob, still hoping to reach the Krusty Krab, begins screaming as he runs as fast as he can. Sandy's lasso reaches SpongeBob the instant he reaches the door of the Krusty Krab, and she attempts to pull him to her as he holds the door with his pinkie finger. Eventually, this causes the entire front of the building to be torn off, revealing the party inside.\nSandy realizes how much her underwater friends care about her, and that Bikini Bottom has become her true home, and decides to stay. The crowd is happy about this and starts cheering (with an exception of Squidward). Suddenly, Patrick once again insults Texas and as the episode ends with the shown off-screen cutting back to Bikini Atoll, Sandy gets angry once again, and Patrick asks if he should start running again."}
{"prompt": "Walking Small", "completion": "The episode begins at Goo Lagoon, where Plankton arrives in his bulldozer to turn the beach into the future site of the \"Chum Bucket Mega Bucket,\" and demands everyone to leave. However, due to his tiny size and small voice nobody pays attention to him. He concludes that he needs someone bigger to assist him, and encounters SpongeBob. Plankton decides to trick SpongeBob into being \"assertive\" in order to get what he wants.\nSpongeBob tries to buy ice cream, but gets cut off once and then has his ice cream stolen before the vendor runs out. However, he finds Plankton \"complaining\" about having an extra ice cream cone he did not want. SpongeBob offers to take the extra one, and as he eats it, Plankton offers to teach SpongeBob how to be \"assertive.\" He tries to get SpongeBob to take his ice cream back from the person who stole it, but SpongeBob's kindly nature prevents him from being able to take it. Plankton, unhappy with SpongeBob's performance, climbs into SpongeBob's mouth and uses his words to forcefully take the ice cream. Afterward, the guy who stole SpongeBob's ice cream runs off crying. When SpongeBob points this out, Plankton lies and says those were the \"tears of joy,\" saying that the guy was happy that SpongeBob was \"assertive.\"\nNext, Plankton attempts to have SpongeBob forcefully take back his metal detector that he lent to another beach-goer, yet SpongeBob misinterprets Plankton's instructions and the person he lent the detector to is led to buried treasure by SpongeBob.\nBy this point, Plankton decides to give up, but SpongeBob promises to prove to him his ability to be assertive. Therefore, Plankton allows SpongeBob another chance. SpongeBob commits a series of both assertive and antagonistic acts to other beach-goers, including stealing the hot dogs of people waiting in line to buy them and cutting the strings of people's kites, and even worse, popping a volleyball that the beach-goers wanted to play with, resulting in everyone leaving the beach.\nPlankton then reveals his true intentions to SpongeBob, making him very upset. SpongeBob defeats Plankton by becoming \"aggressively nice,\" and he undoes the actions that led everyone to leave Goo Lagoon. Plankton leaves the beach due to the crowd returning in response to the overwhelmingly generous acts of kindness that SpongeBob performed. Lastly, everyone plays volleyball using SpongeBob as their ball, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Fools in April", "completion": "The episode begins with SpongeBob waking up and realizing that it is April Fool's Day. Squidward sees him and wonders what SpongeBob is so pleased about, until he looks at the calendar, and realizes that it is April Fool's Day, which he says is SpongeBob's favorite holiday. Fearing the worst has to come, Squidward calls Mr. Krabs saying he caught something terrible and that he would not be able to make it to work. Mr. Krabs says that there is an art collector in his office who wants to buy Squidward's art and name him the artist of the month. So, Squidward immediately rushes to the Krusty Krab, only to find that it was a silly prank by SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs. Squidward attempts to resign from his job, but SpongeBob persuades him to stay, promising not to pull any further pranks on him.\nHowever, SpongeBob continues to prank the customers inside the Krusty Krab while not pranking Squidward but getting carried away with it. The customers do not take offense to SpongeBob's pranks as they are harmless and playful in nature and they even laugh with SpongeBob. Although Squidward is not receiving any more tricks as SpongeBob promised, he gets furious over his and the customers' laughter. Eventually, an angry Squidward decides to get revenge on SpongeBob by showing him what he feels is a \"real\" prank. \nSquidward sets an elaborate rope trap attached to an anchor suspended from the ceiling and squirts a blob of mustard in the middle of the lasso. As SpongeBob goes to clean it up, Squidward cuts the rope holding the heavy anchor, causing SpongeBob to get his foot caught in the rope, triggering a chain reaction that sends him flying around the restaurant, colliding into several objects and areas, ending with him into landing in a garbage can. Squidward laughs hysterically at him, but a hurt SpongeBob runs out of the restaurant crying. Bewildered by SpongeBob's reaction, Squidward calls out to him, saying that he was just kidding, and turns to the customers for support. But the customers are appalled by Squidward's prank, seeing it as far too harsh and nasty to be funny. They all feel sorry for SpongeBob and call Squidward out on this as they storm out of the restaurant in disgust. Distressed at their reaction, Squidward frantically insists that it was only a joke, but as he looks around at the damage his prank did to the restaurant, it slowly dawns on him that SpongeBob's pranks were actually funny, harmless, and meant to make people laugh so that SpongeBob could laugh with them, while his prank was just cruel, and meant to hurt and humiliate SpongeBob so he could laugh at him, all because he was not able to deal with it. Overcome with immense guilt, Squidward realizes that he has no choice but to apologize to SpongeBob.\nSquidward goes to SpongeBob's house and sees SpongeBob's hat behind a rock. He goes over to apologize but then sees that it is just Patrick wearing the hat while digging. Squidward asks why he is wearing the hat and where SpongeBob is, and Patrick tells Squidward that SpongeBob is in the house \"impressed\" (instead of depressed) and was crying a lot. This, of course, makes Squidward feel even more guilty and he rushes over to SpongeBob's house and bangs on the door. He goes so far as to force his way in, but SpongeBob slides his arm through the door and removes the doorknob, clearly in no mood to talk to him. Losing patience, Squidward gets his clarinet and starts playing badly, refusing to stop until SpongeBob reluctantly answers him. Squidward attempts to apologize, but since apologizing to others is not something Squidward normally does, and because of his intense hatred toward SpongeBob, he initially finds himself to be physically incapable of doing so.\nSquidward tries other methods of apologizing to SpongeBob, including sending him an apology note in a bottle but shoving the cork all the way in the bottle and apologizing to SpongeBob far away via two cans attached to a string, but these are foiled by SpongeBob not having a bottle opener and Patrick using the string as floss, respectively. Eventually, he is able to apologize by putting a bubble over his head, so that SpongeBob does not actually hear his apology. Squidward walks away, saying that his conscience is clear, but is confronted by memories of what he did. After he imagines his mother telling him he stinks, he runs back and genuinely apologizes to SpongeBob, even admitting he likes him, his friends, and everyone else in Bikini Bottom, but tells SpongeBob not to tell anyone. SpongeBob promises not to tell and forgives him, but then fully opens his front door, revealing that everyone else is inside behind him, and witnessed Squidward's apology. They all say \"April Fools!\" to Squidward, who is flabbergasted by this. Squidward states that he was fooling them as well before running away to his house, while laughing maniacally, causing SpongeBob to ask, \"What would we do without Squidward?\", ending the episode."}
{"prompt": "Neptune's Spatula", "completion": "The opening of the episode shows SpongeBob and Patrick visiting the Fry Cook Museum, where they see a greasy griddle with a golden spatula embedded in the grease. On it is a plaque, which reads \"Many have tried to pull this spatula out of this ancient grease, but all have failed.\" Larry the Lobster then attempts to pull it out but fails. SpongeBob then reads \"Only a fry cook who's worthy of King Neptune himself can wield the golden spatula.\" SpongeBob, while posing for a photo, accidentally and effortlessly pulls it out while pointing out the menu section to a woman, who in response to the dark clouds appearing in the museum says, \"Holy smokes!\" in a man's voice. It turns out she meant it in a literal sense because then King Neptune appears in a gust of smoke.\nNeptune asks who pulled out the spatula, and everyone says it was SpongeBob. King Neptune refuses to believe this because he doesn't look like the fry cook he was thinking of and asks for proof. Patrick shows him the photograph he took, but Neptune still refuses to consider such a lowly being as SpongeBob worthy to hold the golden spatula. He challenges SpongeBob to a patty-making competition, The Ultimate Cookoff. If SpongeBob wins, he will stay at Atlantis forever and become a god. If he loses, he has to give up fry cooking forever. Patrick continually jeers to Neptune about SpongeBob's skills and says that he could complete up to 500 challenges. He is repeatedly zapped by Neptune three times until all that is left of him is a burnt mark on the floor. SpongeBob asks Neptune to restore Patrick, and he does so (only with Patrick's face now on his rear end).\nIn the Poseidome, King Neptune makes 1,000 Krabby Patties, in the time it takes SpongeBob to make just one, winning the challenge. However, when Neptune shares his patties with the audience, they think that they taste awful. Neptune is angered by this and asks why they would think that SpongeBob's would be any better. He tastes SpongeBob's Krabby Patty and finds it to be delicious. Neptune regurgitates the patty and eats it again, saying \"I think I'd like to try it a second time,\" disgusting the audience in the process.\nAs the episode draws to a close, SpongeBob is declared the winner, but when he finds out that his friends cannot come with him to Atlantis, he tearfully refuses to go to Atlantis, and instead arranges for King Neptune to be a trainee under SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab, teaching him that \"perfect Patties are made with love, not magic.\""}
{"prompt": "Hooky", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, Mr. Krabs rushes to the Krusty Krab while shouting and panicking like a maniac, telling his customers of the \"return of the hooks.\" The other fish ignore him, while SpongeBob is confused, and Mr. Krabs tells him that he has to try not to go near a hook, or he will be brought up to the surface and eaten or sold at a Gift Shop. As SpongeBob returns to the grill, Patrick shows up from outside the window, saying that the new carnival has come to town, insisting that SpongeBob comes with him. He agrees, assuming that he is not quitting work but just taking a break.\nThe two friends go to the carnival, but much to SpongeBob's horror, the \"carnival\" is really the site of the hooks that Mr. Krabs tried to warn everyone about. Patrick deliberately hooks himself and shoots up towards the surface. SpongeBob panics with concern until Patrick returns, explaining that he jumped off and floated down just before he reached the surface. Ignoring what Mr. Krabs said, SpongeBob then plays \"hooky\" with Patrick.\nMeanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, Squidward has taken SpongeBob's place as the fry cook for the time being, and is not making the Krabby Patties correctly, causing a mob of hungry customers to criticize his poor cooking skills. Mr. Krabs bursts out of his office to confront the ruckus and is informed by Squidward that SpongeBob \"took a break,\" making Mr. Krabs angry as SpongeBob has disobeyed his work policy. Mr. Krabs then finds SpongeBob at Fish Hooks Park playing on the hooks with Patrick, shocked at his disobedience. He then scolds the duo for their dangerous behavior and has them make a sailor's promise never to go near the hooks again.\nThe next day, SpongeBob is heading off to work and keeps his promise about not playing on the hooks, until Patrick appears and pressures him to ignore Mr. Krabs and play on them anyway. As much as he is tempted, SpongeBob refuses, knowing what consequences pursue him should he break his promise. Eventually though, seeing a hook in the middle of the street ceases his resistance and SpongeBob then starts playing on the hooks once again. Unfortunately for him, this time he is unable to get off of it, as the hook is attached very tightly to his pants. He goes to confront Mr. Krabs outside of the Krusty Krab to tell him about his current predicament. Mr. Krabs tries to confirm whether or not SpongeBob broke his promise and continued playing on the hooks anyway, with the latter trying to hide the hook in his pants from view. SpongeBob finally admits to doing so in a regretful and apologetic voice. Mr. Krabs tells him that the only solution would be to take off his pants, which SpongeBob reluctantly does. Since the hook has got his underwear too, he is forced to remove that as well, but SpongeBob is very hesitant to out of humiliation. As he is about to be reeled in by the fisherman, he hangs onto the clam pole as a self-restraint method before the hook tears off the underwear instead and SpongeBob is sent flying onto the Krusty Krab doors naked, with Pearl and her friends laughing at him.\nSpongeBob runs back to his house, horrified and embarrassed. Squidward returns to the Krusty Krab with a fishing pole and SpongeBob's underwear, indicating that Mr. Krabs, Pearl, and Squidward got together to teach SpongeBob a lesson about hooks, and Squidward has seen that SpongeBob will never play with hooks ever again.\nJust before the episode is about to come to an end, Patrick is dropped off at his house by the bus, trapped inside a tuna can as karma for playing on the hooks, asking if anyone has a can opener."}
{"prompt": "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy II", "completion": "The episode begins on one Saturday morning, SpongeBob is watching his favorite show, The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, while eating Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Bran Flakes. He has entered a competition and is listening to see if he has won the mystery prize. The announcer pronounces the winner as \"SpringBoob SquirePin,\" for his life-sized Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. SpongeBob calls out that \"SpringBoob SquirePin\" stole his idea before the announcer announces that he has made a \"slight\" error in pronunciation and that the real winner is indeed SpongeBob SquarePants.\nWithin seconds, SpongeBob's prize is delivered to him. SpongeBob has won the conch signal, a conch which has a noise that is a signal which Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy respond to. SpongeBob blows the shell and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy hear it from Shady Shoals Rest Home, springing into action. When they arrive at SpongeBob's house, Mermaid Man at first thinks that SpongeBob has been disfigured before Barnacle Boy recognizes him and points it out to his crimefighting partner. SpongeBob explains to the duo that he won the Conch Signal in a contest and that there is no danger; he is simply seeing if works. They then explain to him the importance of the signal and tell him that he must only use it for major emergencies.\nLater on, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy hear the conch once again while showering and rush to SpongeBob's house, where he appears to be dead on the floor. However, he then reveals that he simply is having trouble opening a jar of mayonnaise. Barnacle Boy is annoyed by this, but Mermaid Man reminds him that emergencies do not come around as often as they used to, and he tells SpongeBob that he can blow the conch \"every once in a while.\" However, SpongeBob ends up constantly calling Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy to help him with normal everyday tasks. Eventually, the two heroes are exhausted and Barnacle Boy confiscates the item and yells at SpongeBob, who is now in tears and apologizing, explaining that he just wanted to spend time with them. Barnacle Boy ignores his pleas and attempts to destroy the conch signal using his iconic 'Sulfur Vision', but cannot bring himself to do so out of weariness.\nMermaid Man stops him from scolding SpongeBob and tells SpongeBob that the conch signal is too great of a responsibility for him. Instead, they let SpongeBob join them on their daily patrol, with SpongeBob dressed as a superhero.\nThey do various activities, such as keeping lookout from on top of a tall building. While patrolling the streets in the Invisible Boatmobile, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy see an old man, who was once the Atomic Flounder. The two joke about how he could possibly return to villainy before SpongeBob attacks the old man, taking the joke seriously. They stop him as he states his misconception, not understanding that the man is no longer a villain or threat. Angered by this revelation, the former Atomic Flounder pushes SpongeBob off of him as he yells at the heroes and blows atomic breath in Barnacle Boy's face, disintegrating it. The fumed old man then storms off from the heroes.\nAt a diner, SpongeBob asks Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy what they will do the next day before they ask SpongeBob to find their theme song on a jukebox. As he tries to find it, they both remark he is a good kid but a pain and decide to \"ditch\" SpongeBob. Outside, however, they are attacked and trapped by their nemesis, the Dirty Bubble. When SpongeBob finally finds the song, which is the special dance mix version, he comes outside to tell them and sees their predicament. He asks the Dirty Bubble for his autograph, saying that he is his favorite super villain, and accidentally pops the Dirty Bubble with the tip of the pencil, saving the day.\nThe trio then ride off in the invisible boatmobile, and closes the episode singing a Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy-themed version of \"Jingle Bells.\""}
{"prompt": "Your Shoe's Untied", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob is watching a dancing anemone on TV, supposedly \"looking for the sports channel.\" Patrick comes bursting through the door with his hands inside a pair of new shoes. When SpongeBob asks to see them on his feet, Patrick confesses that he does not know how to tie his laces. SpongeBob says that he will teach Patrick, untying his shoes to demonstrate. However, SpongeBob's attempts to tie them again fail. After reminding Patrick that he is late for something, Patrick rushes out of the Pineapple, saying that they will have to do the lesson later, and SpongeBob faces the realization that he cannot remember how to tie his shoes, as they have remained tied ever since his life began. When a good night's sleep fails to jog his memory, he decides to set the problem aside for the time being and get a move on to work. Moving, however, presents a problem, as SpongeBob trips over his untied laces every step of the way to the Krusty Krab.\nSpongeBob finally arrives, only to find Patrick already there eating a Krabby Patty. Not wanting to look foolish in front of Patrick, he pounds his feet through the floorboards so that Patrick cannot see them. Patrick only suspects SpongeBob of dieting, so SpongeBob takes care to keep his shoes hidden as he trudges to the kitchen. Even through his exhaustion, SpongeBob realizes he still has to cook, and that doing so standing in one spot will be simple enough. However, bringing the order to Squidward across the room presents a daunting challenge. He tries shuffling over, millimeters at a time, but gets practically nowhere as Squidward orders SpongeBob to move. With one gingerly step forward, he trips and catapults the Krabby Patty into Squidward's mouth. This mishap repeats several times until Squidward is engorged with Krabby Patties, which makes the customers angry.\nMr. Krabs, occupied with a crossword in the bathroom, hears disgruntled customers leaving to eat at the Chum Bucket. He bursts out with his pants down and demands to know why his customers have left. Squidward replies with some difficulty that SpongeBob is to blame, and Mr. Krabs calls for SpongeBob to present himself. Feeling ashamed, SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that he cannot remember how to tie his shoes and asks him for help. Mr. Krabs solemnly informs him that he does not wear shoes.\nIn desperation, SpongeBob starts asking anyone (including Painty the Pirate) if they know how to tie a knot. Failing to find someone who wears shoes, SpongeBob's cries of anguish summon The Flying Dutchman. As it so happens, the Dutchman has held the title of Fancy Knotting Contest Champion for 3,000 years and is confident that he can teach SpongeBob a thing or two about knots. He demonstrates various knots of increasing complexity, but is stumped when SpongeBob asks for a knot for tying shoes. The Dutchman admits that he has no need to tie his shoes as, being a ghost, he no longer has feet. This fact does not impede his enjoyment of wearing a sock on his ghostly tail.\nSpongeBob drags himself home, thinking that his shoes will forever remain untied, but Gary, surprisingly, ties his shoes for him. Gary also reveals that he wears a pair. Amazed, SpongeBob asks Gary where he learned to tie them. Gary reveals a record player underneath his shell and finishes the episode putting on a record of the song \"Loop de Loop,\" which finally teaches SpongeBob how to tie his shoes perfectly."}
{"prompt": "Squid's Day Off", "completion": "As the episode begins, Squidward laments having to work at the Krusty Krab on a Sunday, a day where the restaurant is utterly devoid of customers. His nerves are further frayed by SpongeBob continually testing the service bell. Squidward reminds SpongeBob that he will ring the bell to call in orders, of which there will be none because there are no customers. His frustrated pounding of the cash register causes it to burst open and several coins spill out. Mr. Krabs hears the noise and comes storming out of his office.\nSquidward attempts to pick the coins up, but Mr. Krabs shoves him out of the way and hurriedly scoops them up to wash under the tap. However, SpongeBob comes up, startling Krabs, and a dime drops down the drain. Mr. Krabs quickly sticks his claw in the pipe to catch the dime and grabs hold of it, but his claw gets stuck. Refusing to relinquish the dime, he has SpongeBob assist him in pulling it out. After yanking too hard, Mr. Krabs is detached from his arms, flies backward, slams against the wall. The impact knocks a shelf lose, causing several items to fall onto his head, knocking him unconscious.\nAs Mr. Krabs is being taken away to the hospital, he leaves Squidward in charge of the restaurant. Squidward seizes the opportunity to take the day off, with the excuse of running a few \"very important boss-like errands,\" and leaves SpongeBob in charge of both the grill and the cash register, giving his employee hat to him. As he happily walks home, his mind turns to SpongeBob, imagining him foolishly giving Patrick enough cash to bankrupt the establishment as change for a quarter. This sudden fear causes Squidward to hurry back to the Krusty Krab. After witnessing SpongeBob's impeccable ability to make precise change, Squidward resumes his \"errands.\"\nReturning home with the intent to relax, Squidward next envisions SpongeBob accidentally setting the Krusty Krab on fire. Upon rushing back with a fire extinguisher, he finds things quite un-charred and SpongeBob eagerly awaiting the completion of Squidward's errands. Squidward goes home once more, vowing he will not return to the Krusty Krab, but visions of SpongeBob's increasingly destructive behavior send him back again and again, only to see the Krusty Krab unchanged from his previous frantic visit, and to asked each time by SpongeBob if he has completed his errands.\nOn the brink of insanity, Squidward finally resorts to welding his own door shut so he cannot get out. While attempting to relax with a bath, Squidward thinks he hears SpongeBob's laugh outside, but sees it is merely a branch of coral scratching against his house. He thinks that he sees SpongeBob behind the shower curtain, but it is just his toilet with two toilet paper rolls on top. Then he halucinates SpongeBob in the bath asking him if he is finished with the errands yet, then escapes down the drain, which drives Squidward to burst out of the house naked with only bubbles for clothes, dashing toward the Krusty Krab attempting to beat him there while passing Sadie, her son, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs, just as the latter left the hospital recovered. The sight of Squidward running insane and unclothed causes Mr. Krabs' arms to come loose again.\nBy the time the deranged Squidward bursts into Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is \"already\" there — as he never left. Squidward slowly winds down and regains his sanity, relenting that his errands are finally complete, just in time for the last of his bubbles to pop. SpongeBob lends Squidward his pants and notices that in all this time, nobody came to the Krusty Krab because they never switched the \"Closed\" sign to \"Open\" and that they very easily could have taken the whole day off. As SpongeBob laughs at this, Squidward's nose falls off and his head slowly deflates, ending the episode."}
{"prompt": "Something Smells", "completion": "The episode opens up as SpongeBob wakes up one morning, realizing that it is Sunday, and decides to have an ice cream \"sundae\" for breakfast. However, he sees he has no ice cream and finds standard toppings like bananas and cherries to be blasé, so he instead creates a new type of sundae made from onions, ketchup, and the contents of a nearly dead potted peanut plant. Unbeknownst to SpongeBob, the result of eating the sundae is intensely rancid breath.\nAfter breakfast, SpongeBob begins his Sunday to-do list, which consists of saying \"Hi!\" to everyone in town. Unfortunately, the townspeople are universally disgusted by the smell of SpongeBob's rancid breath and run away from him. SpongeBob is very confused by this, and asks Patrick if he notices anything wrong with him. Patrick, not having a nose, cannot discern the foul odor. After running down a list of possibilities, Patrick concludes that SpongeBob is simply ugly. SpongeBob is dismayed by this revelation and isolates himself in his home.\nLater, Patrick visits SpongeBob, who has resigned to become a hermit and tells Patrick to just go run away from him like everyone else. Patrick then tells SpongeBob the story of The Ugly Barnacle, which fails to cheer him up. Patrick then encourages him to take pride in his ugliness. It works, and SpongeBob's confidence grows, so they decide to go see a movie at the Reef Cinema.\nAs they take their seats, all of the movie-goers still try to avoid SpongeBob, which angers Patrick and sends him into a tirade. Patrick forces the other viewers to look at SpongeBob. With every word SpongeBob speaks, the viewers panic and flee, soon leaving no one in the auditorium. Patrick gets hungry, so they go to the lobby to buy a snack. However, no one is at the counter. Instead, SpongeBob pulls some of his sundaes out of his pocket and gives them to Patrick. After eating them, Patrick feels a sudden urge to use the bathroom.\nWhile washing his hands, Patrick asks a fish next to him for some soap, but he quickly runs away. Upon finding no one will stay within his vicinity, Patrick fears he has caught \"the ugly\" from SpongeBob and hides in a stall with a paper bag over his head.\nEventually, SpongeBob smells Patrick's extremely foul breath and tries to tell the rambling Patrick before shouting at him to get his attention. He then tells Patrick that it is not his appearance, but his breath which stinks, much to Patrick's relief. SpongeBob then asks what he ate, after being told it was the sundae SpongeBob made. The latter realizes that they are not ugly, but simply have bad breath from the sundae.\nImmensely relieved their appearance was not the problem, the two begin to run around shouting, \"We stink!\", causing their noxious breath to melt down the theater. SpongeBob and Patrick run into Squidward, looking at wigs in a window display. The episode ends as SpongeBob cries out in joy, \"Guess what, Squidward? We stink!\" as they hug him, leaving Squidward staring blankly as SpongeBob and Patrick start running away laughing and cheering."}
{"prompt": "Bossy Boots", "completion": "As the episode begins at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is holding a meeting with his employees, informing them that his daughter Pearl is going to be working at the Krusty Krab during her summer vacation and that she has lots of new ideas to improve the restaurant. Squidward does not like the idea of being told what to do by a teenager, and he and SpongeBob agree to stand up to her to protect their jobs.\nPearl soon arrives and SpongeBob's resolution quickly crumbles, adoring the flamboyant new uniform Pearl gives them. After exchanging many ideas, Pearl and SpongeBob agree to turn the Krusty Krab into the \"Kuddly Krab,\" and re-purpose the restaurant into a hip café, all with Mr. Krabs' blessing.\nSquidward remains the only holdout and shakes the newly designed sign in frustration. Two passersby are surprised the Krusty Krab is seemingly gone and, thinking Squidward is a woman, ask him where a place to eat is. Enraged, Squidward quits on the spot and rips off his costume, only for a police officer to write him up for indecent exposure and stick the ticket on him as a loincloth.\nThe Kuddly Krab quickly becomes a hit with the teenage crowd. SpongeBob is told to make a salad, which he has never heard of, so he makes a Krabby Patty and shows it to Pearl. Disgusted, she tells him to take off the buns and the patty, leaving only tomatoes and lettuce. Upon returning to the kitchen, SpongeBob is horrified to see that his stove is gone. Pearl explains to him that Krabby Patties are no longer \"hip,\" and that they now serve only tea and salad. SpongeBob is then given a humiliating mascot costume to wear out front, which finally drives him to complain to Mr. Krabs about what Pearl has done.\nDespite putting on a brave face, Mr. Krabs fully agrees with SpongeBob's complaints and admits that all the renovations that Pearl has done to the restaurant are causing them to lose money. But for as much as Mr. Krabs knows that Pearl has got to go, he can't bring himself to fire his own daughter—instead, he makes SpongeBob be the one to fire her. SpongeBob then calls Pearl into the kitchen, dreading what he has to do. Before he can say anything however, Pearl breaks down crying and reveals to SpongeBob that she's been trying to get herself fired since the beginning—she hates working at the restaurant but took it to please her dad and doesn't want to risk disappointing him by quitting. After hearing all this, SpongeBob comes up with a plan to stage Pearl being fired outside of her dad's office.\nAs Mr. Krabs listens in to the exchange, he debates with himself whether he should allow it to happen. The sight of his empty safe with a spider web finally prompts him to yell to SpongeBob to get on with it, but with the words, \"Pearl, you're fired,\" the strain on Mr. Krabs' heart knocks him out cold. Pearl thanks SpongeBob for letting her go and kisses him on the cheek before dashing off to the mall with her friends.\nSpongeBob enters Mr. Krabs' office to report his success, only to find him passed out on the floor. After being revived with a $20-bill, Mr. Krabs laments what's been done to Pearl—but SpongeBob assures his boss that Pearl's fine, claiming that she's off to bigger and better things. While he's glad that the situation with his daughter is resolved, Mr. Krabs still isn't sure about what to do with all the Kuddly Krabs' decorations/merchandise. SpongeBob happily takes them all home in exchange for one year's salary, which makes Gary sad while the episode ends from there."}
{"prompt": "Big Pink Loser", "completion": "As Patrick wakes up one morning, a mailbox is shoved into his mouth. Curious, he opens it and finds a large, shiny trophy inside. Excited, he starts showing everyone his new award, including the jellyfish and even the Bikini Atoll Island. He shows it off to SpongeBob, who then realizes that the trophy is actually for him after spotting his name on it.\nPatrick is disappointed as he hands the award to SpongeBob, feeling even more disappointed when he unwittingly opens a closet filled to the brim with SpongeBob's awards. SpongeBob tries to help him find a way to win an award, and eventually, Patrick decides to get a job working alongside SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab. Squidward quits in response.\nFirst, Patrick is assigned to take some food to a customer. However, every time he brings it to the customer, he eats it, even as SpongeBob breaks down the process for him. A simpler task SpongeBob gives Patrick is to answer the phone, but he ends up getting angry when he thinks people are calling the wrong number when they are calling the \"Krusty Krab\" (he says \"No, this is Patrick!\" after 3 calls) which SpongeBob then tells him is the actual name of the restaurant. At this point, Patrick is almost completely demoralized, but SpongeBob urges him on. Patrick follows up with sweeping dust from under the floor near table 3, but uses the wrong end of the broom. Suddenly, a delivery man comes in with a load of awards for SpongeBob. This surprises and angers Patrick so much that he whacks the floor with the broom eight times, making dust fly everywhere and all the customers cough. Patrick loses control and laments that he will never win a trophy.\nAfter rushing the upset and disheartened Patrick off into the kitchen, SpongeBob presents him with the extremely simple and basic task of opening a jar. When even this proves to be difficult at first, SpongeBob instructs him to do it exactly as he does. This mantra prompts Patrick to open the jar successfully. However, for a second, Patrick thinks he broke it. SpongeBob tells him he did it right, and he and SpongeBob begin celebrating. Patrick now feels more confident and poised, and he controls his temper by telling SpongeBob how he opened the jar. SpongeBob tells Patrick to do what he does and he will have an award someday.\nThe next day, Patrick starts taking even more cues from SpongeBob. He ends up wearing the same outfit as him and copying every single one of SpongeBob's actions and mannerisms in the hope of achieving the same success as his friend, much to the surprise of the Bikini Bottom citizens, who think they are seeing double of SpongeBob. In annoyance towards Patrick's imitation, SpongeBob seemingly places his hand on a hot grill to prove Patrick was copying him. Patrick takes the bait, and once he cries out in pain, SpongeBob reveals that he was using a decoy hand. As he and Patrick run back to their neighborhood, Patrick's hat flies off, and Squidward picks it up while returning to work. SpongeBob tries multiple antics to convince Patrick to stop copying him, all of which are unsuccessful. SpongeBob even notices that Patrick has painted his rock to look almost exactly like SpongeBob's pineapple.\nSpongeBob resorts to dressing up as Patrick, but it only makes Patrick more certain of the fact that his old self was nothing but a \"big pink loser.\" As it turns out, however, the next award to arrive, which Patrick initially thinks is for SpongeBob again, is actually for a person who won it for \"doing absolutely nothing longer than anyone else.\" This award turns out to be for Patrick, and SpongeBob is proud of him. Overjoyed, Patrick decides to protect his new title by going back under his rock and falling fast asleep, returning to his old, lazy self."}
{"prompt": "Bubble Buddy", "completion": "As every day is a holiday for SpongeBob, he wakes up wearing a Viking costume and proclaims it to be Leif Erikson Day. He then goes outside to celebrate with his friends, but finds notes at the houses of Patrick, Sandy, and Squidward notifying that they cannot, or will not, play with him due to different reasons. SpongeBob decides to, literally, make a new friend, and after several failed attempts with a stick, rock and sink, he blows a bubble figure, whom he names Bubble Buddy.\nThe two go to the Krusty Krab, where SpongeBob orders everything on the menu for Bubble Buddy. However, SpongeBob makes several specifications on Bubble Buddy's behalf that Squidward is forced to bend over backward to accommodate. After the meal, Bubble Buddy pays with \"bubble-money,\" which quickly pops and infuriates Squidward and Mr. Krabs.\nSpongeBob and Bubble Buddy next go to the Goo Lagoon, where they continue to cause trouble with their benign antics: holding up the restroom, causing misunderstandings, and leaving one fish to face high tide. Eventually, the beach-goers become fed up and begin to riot, even tipping over the lifeguard tower. Squidward steps in and blames SpongeBob and the bubble he has created, causing the mob to direct their efforts towards popping Bubble Buddy. They surround SpongeBob and Bubble Buddy, brandishing sewing needles and chanting their intent to pop the bubble. SpongeBob tries to escape by inflating Bubble Buddy, but he fails to be fly away from the crowd's grasp. SpongeBob implores them to realize that Bubble Buddy is his special friend, prompting the crowd to remember similar friends of their own.\nUnfortunately, this is not enough to change their minds. As the crowd throws SpongeBob out of the way, Squidward brings down his needle. All of a sudden, Bubble Buddy comes to life and catches Squidward's arm before the needle reaches him, much to the shock of everyone except SpongeBob. Bubble Buddy informs SpongeBob that \"things are getting a little weird around here,\" and departs in a bubble taxi, floating into the sky and wishing SpongeBob a Happy Leif Erikson Day. The majority of the crowd, satisfied, leaves to go on with their lives. SpongeBob happily cries for his friend blowing up so fast before leaving in a flurry of bubbles. All but one of them pop, and Squidward, left behind in a daze, awkwardly greets it."}
{"prompt": "Dying for Pie", "completion": "The episode begins with Squidward having a dream one night that he is dressed in island clothes and playing the piano on an island. He hits one of the notes, but it makes a bell sound, which is coming from SpongeBob hitting a bell, which in reality is his alarm clock going off revealing that it was all a dream. The episode changes to the next morning at the Krusty Krab, where it is Employee Brotherhood Day, a day on which all employees must exchange gifts that they made themselves. For his gift to Squidward, SpongeBob presents him with a sweater made out of his own eyelashes. When Squidward scoffs at this heartfelt gift, SpongeBob begins to cry copiously, eventually handing Squidward a sweater made from his own tears.\nSquidward, wishing he could simply buy a gift instead of spending time on making one, finds a group of pirates outside with a sack of pies. The pirates claim that these were bombs and Squidward laments on being unable to purchase one, causing the pirates to withdraw their claim and he is given an indeterminate flavor for $25. Squidward presents his supposedly homemade pie to Mr. Krabs, who decides to give it a taste test. He breaks a tiny bit off the crust and goes to get some milk. Tripping on his way, the fallen crumb of pie explodes on contact and wrecks the back of the Krusty Krab, blasting Squidward and Mr. Krabs away. While Mr. Krabs believes it to be a deliberate attempt on his life, Squidward confesses that he bought the pie, ignorant of its contents. Back in Mr. Krabs' office, SpongeBob discovers the \"pie\" that Squidward bought for him, while not noticing the large hole made by the explosion.\nAfter Squidward explains how he got the bomb to Mr. Krabs, they realize that the bomb is still in the Krusty Krab. When they rush back to the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob has apparently eaten the entire pie. Mr. Krabs is disgusted at Squidward for his act and asks how he will live with himself for \"killing\" SpongeBob after all of the nice things the sponge did for him. Squidward then imagines SpongeBob serving food to a customer, only to then suddenly explode into many small cubes from eating the explosive pie. Horrified, Squidward suggests they get him to the hospital to remove it, but Mr. Krabs states that it will not do any good. Having seen this situation play out eleven times prior, he tells Squidward that the pie will explode upon reaching SpongeBob's lower intestine. Squidward still tries to call the hospital, but the doctor reveals to have seen this situation eleven times before as well and cannot save him. A guilt-ridden Squidward laments on SpongeBob's fate and asks how he will tell him. Mr. Krabs insists that Squidward does not tell him, as it will only make him feel worse. He explains to Squidward that SpongeBob has only until sunset to live and says that he should enjoy his final hours. Truly remorseful, Squidward decides to come up with a plan to make SpongeBob's remaining hours the most fun he has ever had, and so he asks him what he would most like to do. SpongeBob presents an extensive list of exactly that. He calls it his \"friendship list.\" A montage of Squidward and SpongeBob playing together is shown.\nThe final activity SpongeBob has planned is watching the sunset with Squidward. Remembering Mr. Krabs' warning about SpongeBob's death, Squidward nervously agrees to participate. As they sit facing the setting sun, SpongeBob casually notes the brick wall Squidward has built between them. SpongeBob then mentions that if he were to die, \"in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend,\" this sunset would be exactly what he would want to see. Squidward begins to tear up at this while SpongeBob lets out a small burp, saying something of indeterminate flavor just hit his lower intestine. With the sun nearly past the horizon, SpongeBob begins a five-second countdown, letting Squidward finish the count. At the end of the first count, with the sun still visible, SpongeBob chuckles that they may have started too early. Squidward, increasingly nervous, begins counting down once more. When he hits \"three,\" the sun finally sets, and an explosion rocks the wall. Squidward breaks down into tears, thankful he was at least able to make SpongeBob's last few hours meaningful.\nAnother explosion occurs, which knocks the wall down, crushing Squidward. He pulls himself out from underneath and, to his bewilderment, finds SpongeBob alive and well and blowing bubble bombs. Squidward angrily berates SpongeBob that he was supposed to explode after eating the pie.\nAt first, SpongeBob is confused, thinking Squidward wants him to \"explode\" in anger. He then remembers the pie that he was saving in his back pocket for them to share, while Squidward realizes he did everything for nothing. SpongeBob then walks over to share the pie with Squidward, only to trip on a rock. The pie bomb splats into Squidward, and the entirety of Bikini Bottom is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. Squidward miraculously survives, uttering \"Ouch\" in pain as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Imitation Krabs", "completion": "As the episode begins with Plankton in his newest bid for the Krabby Patty secret formula entering the Krusty Krab as a robotic salesman, he presents SpongeBob with an offer for one million dollars if he reveals the formula. SpongeBob explains, in no uncertain terms, that the formula is the property of Mr. Krabs and may not be divulged. Enraged, Plankton bursts out of the robot and threatens SpongeBob with violence, only to be caught by Mr. Krabs and shot out from a straw back to the Chum Bucket. Mr. Krabs stresses the importance of the formula's safety to SpongeBob, who takes it upon himself to be more vigilant. However, SpongeBob attacks a customer mentioning the formula in passing, thinking him to be Plankton in another disguise. To prevent further customer trauma, Mr. Krabs clarifies that the formula will be safe as long as SpongeBob only discusses it with him. \nLittle do they know that Plankton's newest robotic disguise has been made in the image of Mr. Krabs. He first encounters Squidward, tasked by the real Mr. Krabs to take inventory of the storage room (in response to his wise-guy remark about \"why do today what you can put off until tomorrow?\"). Plankton, as Robot Krabs, fails to fool Squidward, but the offer of a day off buys Squidward's silence. SpongeBob enters as Squidward skips out and notices Robot Krabs, who he believes is Mr. Krabs; the oddities of the robotic suit only slightly faze SpongeBob. When Mr. Krabs starts calling, however, Robot Krabs distracts SpongeBob and turns into a toaster. To keep Mr. Krabs out of the way after his repeated appearances, Plankton takes out a penny and sends it rolling into Mr. Krabs' office. The enticing coin lures Mr. Krabs out of the restaurant, leaving Plankton's plan unimpeded.\nRobot Krabs finds SpongeBob scrubbing the floors in the kitchen and asks him about the formula. Surprised, SpongeBob says they have not initiated the secret handshake yet, so Robot Krabs allows SpongeBob to lead them through it. The \"handshake\" consists of standing on one foot, balancing a glass of chocolate milk on their heads, and singing the Bikini Bottom national anthem. What follows is a ritual that goes on for six and a half hours and consists of many bizarre and ridiculous feats, leaving Plankton worn out from controlling Robot Krabs. After all this, SpongeBob still will not discuss the formula, causing Plankton to explode in anger at all of the things that he did were seemingly for nothing. However, SpongeBob explains that it simply must not be discussed out loud and holds up a bottle containing the formula in written form.\nAs Robot Krabs eagerly reaches for the bottle, the rolling penny from earlier enters the kitchen, followed by the real Mr. Krabs. He gets into an argument with Robot Krabs, and the two try to convince SpongeBob that they are the genuine article. Unable to handle the situation calmly, SpongeBob threatens the both of them with a vat of tartar sauce until he gets some answers, deciding that the best way to weed out the impostor is to present the two with a quiz about the Krusty Krab. The first two questions are generic ones that anyone who has been to the restaurant could answer and Robot Krabs answers both correctly. The third and final question is one so complicated that not even the real Mr. Krabs can answer it. SpongeBob promptly blasts him with the tartar sauce and rolls him out the door in a fry basket, convinced he is the impostor. \nBelieving Robot Krabs to be the real Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob presents him with the formula. As Plankton laughs in triumph, SpongeBob notices the penny that Mr. Krabs was chasing and unwittingly drops it into Robot Krabs' coin-operated self-destruct mechanism. With only ten seconds until detonation, Plankton briefly ponders the intelligence of such a design choice before making a frantic dash back to the Chum Bucket. Unfortunately, he arrives too late and the robot explodes, obliterating his restaurant and causing the metal fist to crush Plankton (a simple \"ouch\" shows he is only injured). As the formula bottle rolls back to SpongeBob, he realizes his grave error. \nSuddenly, Mr. Krabs is heard screaming for help, and he is shown still in the fry basket fending off Hans wielding a fork. SpongeBob rushes over and carts Mr. Krabs back to the Krusty Krab, apologizing for believing him to be the impostor. Mr. Krabs forgives him, but ends the episode by saying that the penny will be coming out of his paycheck."}
{"prompt": "Wormy", "completion": "As the episode commences, SpongeBob and Patrick are given the task of pet-sitting Sandy's pets while she is out of town. One of the many animals left in their care is a small Monarch caterpillar named Wormy. Despite it requiring the least attention, SpongeBob and Patrick quickly befriend the caterpillar and enjoy a day of play together. As the two leave, they vow to have even more fun with Wormy the next day.\nOvernight, Wormy undergoes a quick metamorphosis and becomes a monarch butterfly. When they return the following morning, SpongeBob and Patrick search for their new friend, but merely see what looks like a beautiful winged creature instead. Upon opening the jar and finding only Wormy's discarded chrysalis and best friend ribbon inside, they come to the grim conclusion that this \"horrific beast\" has devoured Wormy and is now on the loose. They try to trap the supposed monster by disguising Patrick as bait. When this fails, SpongeBob manages to encase the butterfly in a bubble and releases it outside the treedome, in attempt to \"save\" Sandy's pets. However, now the butterfly is loose in Bikini Bottom, so SpongeBob and Patrick chase after it.\nBeating the creature to the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob interrupts Squidward's photoshoot of Mr. Krabs with the first dollar he owned since the Krusty Krab opened, so he could warn Mr. Krabs and Squidward, both of whom scoff at the tiny insect. However, with one good look at its face, the two are scared senseless and run away, their discarded undergarments leaving SpongeBob and Patrick to believe that they were also eaten.\nSpongeBob and Patrick begin to spread news of the \"terrible monster\" throughout Bikini Bottom. Mass chaos erupts with every tiny flap of its wings, and as a result of the people's hysteria, the whole town ends up destroyed in a fire.\nA few days later, Sandy arrives back at the ravaged town, saying that it looks like a twister hit it and wonders where everyone is. Wormy then flies up to her and she recognizes him, saying that he was not supposed to change until her return, and places him inside a jar. As the episode concludes with all the townsfolk cheering and celebrating the capture of the so-called monster, Sandy believes it to be just because they missed her that much, and thinks maybe she should go out of town more often."}
{"prompt": "Patty Hype", "completion": "The episode begins at the Krusty Krab, having gone without a customer for 36 days, is filled with dust, cobwebs, and even a skeleton. An emaciated Incidental 42 crawls in, claiming that he has not had any sustenance in three days. After confirming Incidental 42 can pay, Mr. Krabs has SpongeBob bring him a meal. However, Incidental 42 refuses, saying that there is no pizzazz in the Krusty Krab, and so resumes his search for food, water, and atmosphere. Mr. Krabs remains skeptical, but then he overhears a conversation between Tom and Fred about a talking dog at the Shell Shack and realizes that what he needs is a gimmick to attract customers. SpongeBob tries to share an idea, but Mr. Krabs ignores him and decides instead to bury himself alive, which will easily draw in a crowd. When news of the talking dog singing reaches them, though, they quickly leave.\nSpongeBob remains ignored by Mr. Krabs, who desperately racks his brain for an answer, until he appears from the heavens heralding to Mr. Krabs his idea. Finally having his attention, SpongeBob shows him a green patty. Mr. Krabs is disgusted, thinking that the patty is spoiled, and he tries to incinerate it. SpongeBob then removes his fire-proof suit to reveal Pretty Patties, Krabby Patties painted in \"six designer colors.\" Mr. Krabs and Squidward laugh at this notion, mocking SpongeBob with other ridiculous novelties such as sequin milkshakes and bow-tie French fries. Deeply hurt, SpongeBob quits his job as a fry cook and vows to open his own restaurant and prove them wrong, making them laugh all the more.\nWith Patrick's help, SpongeBob sets up a stand in front of his house to sell his Pretty Patties, though it initially seems unsuccessful. He tries to give passerby Incidental 40 a Pretty Patty, who laughs at its green color. SpongeBob is about to give up when Incidental 40 notices a Patty in purple, his favorite color, and proclaims Pretty Patties to be the best idea ever.\nNews of the skyrocketing sales of Pretty Patties reaches Mr. Krabs at a rundown Krusty Krab, who incredulously decides to take a look. There are thousands of customers surrounding the stand, clamoring for their turn. Mr. Krabs notes that he has never had a line before, much less the 46,853 customers that SpongeBob is currently waiting on. Finally making it through the crowd, Mr. Krabs meekly congratulates SpongeBob on his success. While proud of what he has achieved, SpongeBob admits he misses his days at the Krusty Krab. Seeing an opportunity, Mr. Krabs persuades SpongeBob to give him the rights to his Pretty Patty stand in exchange for the key to the Krusty Krab. Utterly entranced with his fortune, SpongeBob starts rollicking inside and outside his new restaurant.\nThe next day, as Mr. Krabs prepares to rake in the dough, the customers all angrily arrive, demanding refunds. They complain that the Pretty Patties had an unfortunate side effect: whatever color was eaten is what color part of the customer's body became. Incidental 42, demonstrating a glow-in-the-dark tongue, states that all 46,853 of them want their money back, but under the cover of darkness, the cheapskate Mr. Krabs has hightailed it.\nThe customers form an angry, rainbow-colored mob and begin chasing Mr. Krabs, leaving a rainbow trail behind them. He runs to the Krusty Krab and attempts to unlock the door, but remembers that he gave his key to SpongeBob, who is currently preoccupied with the sound of his beloved squeaky pickles. Mr. Krabs unsuccessfully tries to get SpongeBob's attention as the mob continues to chase him which ends the episode."}
{"prompt": "Grandma's Kisses", "completion": "SpongeBob visits his grandmother's house, where he indulges in several \"childish\" activities such as eating cookies, licking the spoon, and listening to stories. As soon as the clock strikes 3:00 PM, SpongeBob's grandma drives him to work. Once there, she kisses him goodbye, leaving a \"kissy\" mark on his forehead. Everyone at the Krusty Krab teases SpongeBob about this and he runs home crying.\nBack at home, Patrick tells SpongeBob that he should show his grandma that he is not a baby anymore, and that he should try to act more like an adult. The next day, they go to Grandma's house wearing sideburns. When Grandma answers the door and tries to kiss SpongeBob, he explains to her that he is an adult now, and the kissing has to stop.\nGrandma offers them cookies, which Patrick gladly gobbles down. When SpongeBob tries to talk him out of it, Patrick proclaims that being a grownup is boring, and that he enjoys acting like a baby. SpongeBob tries to eat a cookie, but Grandma gives him a piece of steamed coral instead. Grandma then reads Patrick a children's storybook about a magical sea leprechaun, and gives SpongeBob a large book on routine active maintenance. She also gives Patrick a sweater \"with love in every stitch,\" while SpongeBob receives unwrapped office supplies. Soon, the clock strikes 3:00 PM, and Grandma reminds SpongeBob that he has to go to work. \nAs Grandma tucks Patrick in for a nap, SpongeBob says that his busy adult schedule will make it hard for him to visit. Grandma seems unconcerned with this, so SpongeBob leaves. However, he soon comes back inside, his manly sideburns falling away. SpongeBob declares that he refuses to grow up, and that he wants to become a baby again and do all the things he did when he was a baby, such as eating cookies, drinking milk, wearing diapers, riding in baby carriages and wagons, cuddling with teddy bears, riding on rocking seahorses, and getting kisses. He then cries so intensely that he floods the house. \nGrandma calms him down and pulls a plug in the floor to drain out his tears. She tells SpongeBob that he does not have to be a baby to get her love; he can kiss his grandma and still be an adult, because no matter how grown up he gets, she will always love him. Grandma gives him back his sideburns, hands him a cookie, and SpongeBob starts to feel better. He asks her to not bring this whole debacle up to everyone at the Krusty Krab, not knowing, however, that Squidward and all the Krusty Krab customers are watching from the window."}
{"prompt": "Squidville", "completion": "As the episode opens, SpongeBob and Patrick receive new reef blowers in the mail, and begin blowing and sucking things up with them. Eventually, they suck up Squidward's windows and door, trapping Squidward inside. Squidward tunnels his way out and demands they put his door and windows back. In SpongeBob and Patrick's attempt to do so, the reef blowers shoot them out with such force that Squidward's house is completely destroyed. As the debris falls, Squidward tells them that this is the final straw, and that he refuses to live next to them anymore. Just then, his TV lands amidst the rubble and turns on, playing a commercial for Tentacle Acres, a private community created exclusively for folks as desperate to move as he is. But before he can actually hear the name of the place, Patrick changes the channel and says \"I hate this channel.\" Luckily, Squidward manages to take the remote from Patrick and learn of the name and where it is.\nSquidward arrives at the front gate, and after a short interview over the intercom where he confirms that he is neither a sponge nor a starfish, he is allowed to enter. Although he has a run-in and small confrontation with another local resident, to his delight, Squidward finds that the residents all look, sound, and act similar to him, even living in houses identical to his prior home. Before Squidward can go to sleep, eager to start his new life, however, SpongeBob and Patrick call in an attempt to get him to come back. But Squidward refuses, saying that there is no possible way he is passing up the chance of being among his own kind.\nSquidward begins his first day at Tentacle Acres by going biking, and he finds that all the other residents are riding their bikes as well. He then goes grocery shopping, and is impressed by the local food market, which even carries canned bread. He then sees an Interpretive Dance Academy, where he joins the group in synchronized interpretive dance. At the end of the day, he sees a clarinet-playing trio performing in the park, which he makes a quartet by joining. Squidward's second day at Tentacle Acres is just like the first, a fact he enjoys immensely. However, as more time goes by, each day exactly the same as the last, Squidward slowly loses enthusiasm for the endless routine. Finally, Squidward realizes that nobody in Tentacle Acres stands out and that his dream life is in a complete loop and so laments he \"doesn't feel like playing the clarinet\" and leaves in the middle of the song and leaves for home.\nWhile sitting on a park bench, lamenting his attainment of \"too much paradise,\" Squidward hears a reef blower. For a split second he thinks it's SpongeBob, but then sees that it's only a park worker. The worker leaves the reef blower unattended and Squidward is slowly tempted to start playing with it, irritating and scaring his neighbors out of their wits in the process. They eventually become fed up with his behavior and form an angry mob to chase him down.\nMeanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick come to Tentacle Acres to apologize to Squidward, and try to convince him to return home. The surveillance guards tell them that their kind isn't welcome, and refuses to open the gate for them. However, Patrick's bad breath from some fried oyster skins he had travels through the intercom into the security room, knocking the guards out and causing them to fall over onto the button that opens the gate. They enter the village and come across the angry mob cornering Squidward, but are unable to identify Squidward among the crowd of near-identical residents.\nThe mob presents to Squidward a \"well thought-out and organized list of complaints,\" then Squidward makes a complaint himself about how everyone acts just like him in a single town. The police officer and the rest of the mob tell him that he doesn't need to stay and suggest he leaves, and Squidward wholeheartedly agrees. As SpongeBob and Patrick continue their search, Squidward uses the reef blower to launch himself out of the village yelling \"Freedom!\". SpongeBob concludes, \"Well, we know one thing: it sure isn't that guy!,\" just as the episode comes to a close."}

SpongeBob doesn't understand why Sandy is in such a hurry, so she reminds him that she will start hibernating the following week. With only 168 hours left, Sandy has many activities she is desperate to do. SpongeBob promises to commit all the time he doesn't work for Mr. Krabs to do these activities with Sandy, an offer she enthusiastically takes him up on.\nTheir activities that run day and night include sand-boarding, trying to knock each other off the top of the Sea Needle with giant ear cleaners, \"extreme jacks,\" and \"find the hay in the needle stack.\" These prove to be extremely dangerous, and SpongeBob, much less hardy than Sandy, injures himself and avoids death several times. Not wanting to do anymore dangerous activities with Sandy. He goes into hiding under Patrick Star's house to escape from her, and Sandy, panicking for his safety, forces everyone in Bikini Bottom to form an unnecessary search party for SpongeBob.\nSandy has them search in dangerous places such as sulfur fields, a leech farm, and a poison sea urchin cove. After days of searching with no success, they all want a break, but she does not relent. They ask for time to take care of their children, but Sandy merely suggests to have the children crawl into places that adults cannot reach. With the dissent growing, Sandy angrily demands that no one leaves until they find SpongeBob. The townspeople try in vain to fool Sandy with objects in SpongeBob's shape and color like a cereal box and a banana. One fish points to SpongeBob supposedly up in the sky, but as Sandy looks up and turns back in confusion, she finds that everyone has gone, taking their chance to also hide under Patrick's rock.\nStill frantic, Sandy starts literally destroying the city in her search for SpongeBob. The townspeople express how safe they feel under the rock, as does SpongeBob, whom they unceremoniously throw out for Sandy to find. Sandy rushes to SpongeBob as he desperately tries to hide again, to no avail. Sandy joyfully pulls SpongeBob for a hug before tugging him along to go \"atom smashing,\" but he pleads for her to wait and listen to him. SpongeBob finally explains to her that he can no longer play the dangerous games she wants to play and begs for her to remain his friend. However, he realizes that Sandy has already fallen sound asleep, and the relieved and exhausted SpongeBob falls asleep as well.

{"prompt": "Life of Crime", "completion": "The episode starts at the Krusty Krab, where SpongeBob, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs are watching a classic black-and-white crime movie. Mr. Krabs speaks out against thieves like the one depicted in the movie, but SpongeBob and Patrick remind him of all the stuff he has that is not his: a barrel from Salty Sea Farms, a towel from the Sizzling Spring Sauna, a Bikini Bell phone, Sandy's hedge clippers, Plankton's lawnmower, and Mrs. Puff's hair curlers. Mr. Krabs claims that he \"borrowed\" all those things, telling them that it is okay to borrow something as long as they give it back before it is missed. \nLater that day, SpongeBob and Patrick spot a balloon stand. Since they do not have any money, they decide to follow Mr. Krabs' advice and \"borrow\" a balloon. They sneak away with it, and as they talk about all the fun things they plan to do with it, it suddenly pops. Realizing that they can no longer return the balloon, they concede to each other that they have stolen it. When they panic and bump into the owner of the balloon stand, they run away before he reveals that it is National Free Balloon Day. They decide to leave Bikini Bottom under the belief that they are wanted criminals, not realizing that they never committed any crime.\nThat night, they camp in the middle of nowhere and lament that they will never see any of their friends or do any of the fun things they used to do again, causing Patrick and SpongeBob to be sad and miss their old lives. However, they then begin to look at the positives, such as not having to live by society's standards and not having to return anything they borrow, and so convince themselves that their lives as fugitives can be enjoyable. Patrick sadly remarks that they still have nothing to eat, until SpongeBob unveils two chocolate bars, which he hopes they can survive on for the rest of their lives. However, Patrick eats his entire bar in two quick bites, immediately forgets he ate it, and upon trying to take a third bite of it, discovers that it is gone.\nUpon seeing SpongeBob's unopened candy bar, Patrick accuses him of stealing it. Although SpongeBob tries to remind Patrick that he already ate his and never ate his own, he refuses to believe him. SpongeBob offers half of his chocolate to him, but Patrick says he does not want it unless SpongeBob admits that he took it. Frustrated at Patrick's behavior, SpongeBob eats the whole thing himself. In his own frustration, Patrick decides to report SpongeBob to the police. SpongeBob aims to tell on Patrick first and they race to the police station.\nOnce there, they both confess their original \"crime\" together, and two officers at the station realize that SpongeBob and Patrick are under a serious misunderstanding, and place them in a jail cell. However, the two \"criminals\" are immediately released, being informed that they \"stole\" the balloon on National Free Balloon Day, much to the officers' amusement. SpongeBob and Patrick, though shocked to learn of their innocence, vow that they will never borrow anything without permission again and the officers give them lollipops for the trip back home. Once again, Patrick eats his immediately and accuses SpongeBob and the officers of stealing it. They all laugh together until Patrick says he means it, as the episode ends with a shot of Bikini Atoll being seen."}
{"prompt": "Christmas Who?", "completion": "As the special opens, it is almost Christmas in Encino, California, and Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, is deep in preparations for the holiday. With the help of his unenthusiastic assistant, Potty the Parrot, Patchy sets pictures of SpongeBob and Patrick on the mantelpiece, puts up his various SpongeBob-themed ornaments, and bakes Christmas cookies, the dough of which Potty eats. Patchy also takes time to open a letter from a fan, who asks if SpongeBob likes Christmas as much as he does. Patchy remarks that there was once a time when Christmas in Bikini Bottom was unheard of, and decides to tell the tale.\nOutside Sandy's treedome, SpongeBob is dressed in his karate gear and preparing to give Sandy a surprise sneak attack. Inside, Sandy is putting up Christmas lights, which SpongeBob mistakes for fire and tries to put it out with sea water. After recovering from the drenching, Sandy is shocked to find out that SpongeBob has never heard of Christmas, and tells him all about it.\nLater at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob passes the story of Christmas on to Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs. Everyone in Bikini Bottom, except Squidward, is excited at the idea of Santa Claus bearing gifts, and they all, except Squidward, put their Christmas letters into glass bottles, which are then shot up to the surface for Santa to receive as the act ends. The Bikini Bottomites decorates for Christmas as SpongeBob and Patrick sings a song. They even decorate Squidward's house which Squidward does not agree with. After the song, Squidward closes his blinds.\nAct 2 begins as SpongeBob is sending the last of the letters to Santa, and finds out Squidward still has not written his letter yet. SpongeBob and a few citizens try to get him to write a letter and be in the Christmas spirit, but it fails. In the days leading up to Christmas, the people of Bikini Bottom heartily celebrate, and on Christmas Eve, they stand in front of the large decorated coral tree and sing, eagerly awaiting the arrival of Santa. Squidward, refusing to believe in Santa Claus, takes no part in any of the mirths.\nThe people continue to sing until morning, when they realize that Santa has not come. Everyone leaves in disappointment, and they call SpongeBob out on his lying. Patrick tries to tell the people that Santa had stopped for a snack and so SpongeBob and Patrick are waiting for Santa, until they realize that he really does not exist, SpongeBob becomes heartbroken. In realty, Santa didn't come because they were supposed to be asleep. Squidward wakes and comes out, at last, laughing at SpongeBob's humiliation, and even takes a photo to commemorate the occasion.\nAs SpongeBob sadly trudges away, he hands Squidward a present. Squidward, still skeptical, opens it to find a hand-carved driftwood clarinet. Squidward sees how SpongeBob has only been trying to spread joy, he feels very remorseful for what he did, and decides to make up for his rudeness. He dresses up as Santa and surprises SpongeBob, who thanks him for bringing Christmas to Bikini Bottom.\nSquidward prepares to go back inside his house but is approached by a little girl, asking him for a present. Out of desperation, Squidward gives the child a large wrench, which pleases her greatly. A large crowd arrives asking for presents, and he ends up giving away everything he owns. Squidward realizes the lengths he has gone to in preserving SpongeBob's dream, and after shooing away an excited SpongeBob, he discovers a note on his doorstep, which turns out to be a message from Santa thanking him for his help. He looks up in time to see the real Santa Claus soaring overhead in his sleigh, as he is shocked that he was wrong about his existence. At a loss at seeing Santa, he dismisses himself as being insane and plays his new clarinet before going back inside.\nAfter finishing his story, Patchy has to deal with Potty perching on his head. However, it turns out the parrot merely lays him a gift of goodwill, which touches Patchy's heart. Patchy then proceeds to step under the mistletoe, inviting the ladies to come by for a smooch, only for Potty to start swooping after him. With Patchy preoccupied, the narrator rounds things off by wishing a \"Good night, and Happy Holidays,\" to end the special."}
{"prompt": "Survival of the Idiots", "completion": "Starting out the episode, SpongeBob and Patrick excitedly race to Sandy's treedome to hang out with her. However, the entire dome has a metal cover over it and a \"Keep Out\" sign on the front door. In the entryway, they find a TV, which turns on, and plays a video of Sandy dressed for bed, and gobbling on loads of acorns. The recording of Sandy explains that she is hibernating for the winter, and asks for no one to disturb her, including SpongeBob as she said so explicitly at the end of the video recording. However, even though prohibited to do so, Patrick opens the door anyway to reveal that the dome's environment is completely covered with snow.\nThen SpongeBob and Patrick quickly take delight in the snow, even being able to remove their water helmets because of the snow's moisture. When they hear a strange noise from Sandy's treehouse, they go inside to investigate. They then discover that Sandy is many times her original size from eating loads of acorns, and is sleeping soundly. At first, their gentle prodding, and poking do nothing to wake her from her dreams of catching the outlaws Dirty Dan and Pinhead Larry.\nSoon enough, though, their merrymaking takes its toll, and then Sandy suddenly wakes up, assaulting SpongeBob and Patrick in her sleepy stupor. Then she falls back to sleep in her bed. Patrick then makes a pair of earmuffs from his belly button lint, which SpongeBob places over Sandy's ears to prevent her from waking up.\nThen SpongeBob and Patrick leave her room to continue playing in the snow. They pretend to be the outlaws from Sandy's dream, but then they start fighting over which one of them will play the part of being Dirty Dan. Their roughhousing knocks down Sandy's earmuffs off, allowing her to hear all the noise, and set upon them and attacks them in further half-asleep fury. Being battered and bruised, with the winter storm growing more intense, SpongeBob and Patrick try to leave, but then they find that the door's frozen shut, leaving them trapped in the wintery treedome.\nUnable to escape or survive in the cold weather, SpongeBob tries to take a piece of bark from the tree, but the sleeptalking Sandy, still thinking he is Pinhead Larry, threatens to put him in an iron lung. He takes it as a sign that he should put it back. They go into Sandy's room and, throwing caution to the wind, rip off all her fur. With their new fur-lined winter attire, SpongeBob proclaims that now they are ready for the \"longest, coldest winter ever!\" However, winter immediately comes to an end, and then Sandy wakes up with her winter pounds shed. Sandy sees SpongeBob and Patrick outside from her window and is excited to see them. She then comes out of her treehouse, and Sandy is initially surprised and confused to see SpongeBob and Patrick wearing her fur, but when she looks down at herself, she finds herself completely bald and becomes utterly livid at her friends. SpongeBob and Patrick then realize that ripping her fur off was not a good idea, and now they have to suffer the consequences.\nTo punish SpongeBob and Patrick for what they did, Sandy forbids them from leaving, and drinks lemonade with them, with their bodies tightly wrapped around her to provide her new spring coat to keep her warm until her fur grows back, much to SpongeBob and Patrick's discomfort and dismay while the episode ends."}

At the end of the day, Gary seems to want to spend time with Patrick a while longer, so SpongeBob agrees to let Gary have a sleepover at Patrick's house. The next morning, Gary is still reluctant to leave Patrick, who concludes that Gary wants to be with him permanently, and so claims him as his own pet. SpongeBob refuses to believe this, but when Gary is given the choice of who shall be his owner, Gary heads for Patrick. SpongeBob is heartbroken, and out of jealousy, he attempts to find a new pet to show Gary that he does not need a two-timing snail.\nFirst, SpongeBob gets Rex, a worm, and shows him off to Patrick and Gary. SpongeBob extols all the traits that make worms superior to snails, such as their loyalty. Rex promptly illustrates this by completely abandoning SpongeBob and hitching a ride on a bus. Next, SpongeBob brings home Larry, a snail with a terrible temperament. SpongeBob bends over backward to accommodate Larry, even giving up his own bed to the picky and greedy snail, but Larry's unceasing viciousness leaves SpongeBob forlorn and he probably runs away as Rex did. Even the anatomically correct snail, Jerry, cannot fill the hole in SpongeBob's heart.\nPatrick, accompanied by Gary, stops by SpongeBob's house to do some laundry. In desperation, SpongeBob begs and pleads with Gary, offering him the privilege to do whatever he wants if he comes back. Patrick patronizingly tells SpongeBob to let it go, that Gary has already made his choice. Gary, meanwhile, crawls into the washing machine after Patrick throws his shorts in. SpongeBob and Patrick watch, and Patrick is angry that Gary apparently just likes him for his shorts. SpongeBob, however, realizes that all along Gary had only wanted the cookie that was in Patrick's pocket.\nAs SpongeBob and Gary, now satiated and reunited, go outside for a walk, a heartbroken and devastated Patrick stares at the door and closes the episode saying, \"Gary?

{"prompt": "No Free Rides", "completion": "The episode opens when SpongeBob's last boating exam of the year ends in failure after he runs over the French narrator. Despite the failing grade, SpongeBob remains optimistic that his next year in Mrs. Puff's class will be productive. Mrs. Puff, on the other hand, dreads the thought of another year administering boating exams for SpongeBob. In desperation, she offers him an extra credit exam: a short, ten-word thesis on one thing he learned in boating school. SpongeBob finds himself not able to decide what to pick, and he starts to have a nervous breakdown. But Mrs. Puff, completely tired of SpongeBob, lets him pass anyway.\nAs SpongeBob leaves with his new driver's license, Mrs. Puff ponders over whether she's done the wrong thing and starts feeling guilt, then has a terrible daydream of him destroying the town with his driving. She consoles herself with the fact that SpongeBob lacks a boat to drive, much less one to wreck. Upon arriving at her home, however, she finds SpongeBob and his parents inside with a huge cake to thank her for her teachings, as futile as they had once seemed. Both SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff get another surprise when they see that SpongeBob's parents bought him a brand new boatmobile. In utter amazement, SpongeBob falls into the cake in a dead faint. As SpongeBob's parents take him home, Mrs. Puff realizes the danger he now poses and decides to settle the matter before anyone figures out she let him skip through boating school.\nSpongeBob's parents tuck him into his bed and tell him that, due to his head injury, he should avoid driving anywhere that night. As soon as his parents leave, he sneaks out his bedroom window, gets into the boat, and falls asleep. Not long after, Mrs. Puff hijacks SpongeBob's boat and drives it away. SpongeBob wakes up to find the masked Mrs. Puff in the process of stealing his vehicle and fights her off.\nMrs. Puff tries knocking SpongeBob out of the boat, but he grabs hold of the rear bumper. She next drives through various obstacles to lose him, but he catches up to her while two police officers watch the commotion from their vehicle.

Mrs. Puff apologizes to SpongeBob and says that she shouldn't have passed him when she knew he really wasn't ready. SpongeBob understands he'll have to relinquish his license, but Mrs. Puff tells him he can still continue his lessons with Mrs. Flounder, another driving teacher starting a new class. As the episode closes, SpongeBob assures her she is the only one who he wants teaching him, giving her a tip that the warden will let her go early in exchange for free driving lessons."}
{"prompt": "I'm Your Biggest Fanatic", "completion": "As the episode starts off, SpongeBob and Patrick are attending the Biannual Jellyfish Convention. Patrick takes pleasure in touching every display in sight, much to the ire of the security guard. SpongeBob, meanwhile, focuses on the \"Jellyspotters,\" a famous jellyfish enthusiast club, and fawns over its leader, Kevin the Sea Cucumber. At first, Kevin rebuffs SpongeBob's adoration. However, after realizing that SpongeBob will go to any lengths to please him, Kevin decides to let him try out for the Jellyspotters, thinking his antics will make for a good laugh.\nKevin's first test for SpongeBob is to catch a jellyfish, which proves quite simple for SpongeBob as one immediately flies into his net. Kevin smacks it out in annoyance, causing it to sting him. He revises the quota to two jellyfish, and two jellyfish nestle into SpongeBob's net. Even an increase to 20 jellyfish simply prompts more of them to arrive. Kevin angrily kicks the net, inciting the wrath of the jellyfish. He then puts the jellyfish jelly on SpongeBob's mouth to attract the jellyfish, and while the jellyfish were licking SpongeBob's mouth, the jellyfish tickle SpongeBob's nose causing him to sneeze the jellyfish at Kevin's eyes so that Kevin gets stung again. Undeterred, Kevin continues to give SpongeBob many more tests, all of which SpongeBob passes effortlessly while Kevin gets stung relentlessly.\nKevin, covered in stings and extremely frustrated, tells SpongeBob that his final test will be to catch a queen jellyfish. He then ties SpongeBob to a post, provides him a whistle that produces a \"Queen Jellyfish call\" which sounds much like the word \"loser\" and leaves him there.\nAfter a great length of time blowing the call, SpongeBob is very tired and prepared to give up before a queen jellyfish finally arrives. SpongeBob's joy is short-lived as he discovers Kevin has gone and the large jellyfish begins chasing him. Eventually, the queen corners him at the edge of a cliff, where it is revealed to be a robot piloted by Kevin and the anchovy club members. Kevin reveals his true intentions to SpongeBob and shows him several other people at the bottom of the pit below, all of whom were his former \"biggest fans.\"\nKevin and his crew start calling SpongeBob a loser. However, before Kevin can force SpongeBob off the cliff, an even larger king jellyfish appears and falls in love with the robot queen. Puckering up for a kiss, the king pursues the contraption until it crashes and reveals its occupants. The furious king chases down SpongeBob, Kevin, and the anchovies, eventually cornering them in a cave. Kevin panics, admitting that he has no actual expertise in dealing with jellyfish and that he was only in it for the fashion. SpongeBob, the only one brave enough to confront the king jellyfish, blows for him a giant pie bubble, which the king happily accepts and leaves with. When an incredulous Kevin asks how he was able to do it, SpongeBob simply tells him that everybody loves pie. The anchovies cheer SpongeBob for his heroism, but Kevin denies SpongeBob club membership for not actually catching a queen jellyfish. Having had enough of Kevin's attitude, the anchovies forcibly remove Kevin's crown which is actually his feeding tentacles and place it atop SpongeBob. SpongeBob is amazed by his new hat, Kevin painfully informing him that's not what it is.\nBack at the convention, SpongeBob tells Patrick about his experience and reveals that he turned down the Jellyspotters' offer to join; jellyfishing is, most of all, about the jellyfish themselves. Patrick remarks upon how much SpongeBob has matured regarding hero worship, and the episode finishes as they depart with Patrick's own hero, Jeffrey the Jellyfish, tied up in a wagon with a sad look on his face."}

The two hero hopefuls long to play with the various gadgets, but are left with the express command to not touch anything.\nWhile wandering around the Mermalair, SpongeBob and Patrick find Man Ray, one of Mermaid Man's most fearsome nemeses, encapsulated in a prison of frozen tartar sauce. SpongeBob longs to pepper the villain with questions, prompting Patrick to activate the unfreezing process. As the two argue over the ramifications, Man Ray awakens, only to find the majority of his body still frozen. SpongeBob informs him they cannot let him go due to his evil nature. Man Ray convinces them that he is actually good, and so they release him. He quickly attempts to attack them, but is stopped by the tickle belt he still wears: a device that, with the push of a button, tickles whoever is locked into it.\nMan Ray sobs crocodile tears over his situation, expressing a desire for someone to teach him how to be a good person. SpongeBob and Patrick offer their services, and Man Ray accepts with the intention of jumping ship once the belt is off. Their first lesson starts with what to do if someone has dropped their wallet. Patrick drops his wallet and Man Ray tries to give it to him, but Patrick constantly denies it being his wallet. Man Ray's attempts to convince Patrick to take it result only in anger and he nearly attacks Patrick for his idiocy, causing another use of the tickle belt.\nThe second lesson, involving helping someone carry a heavy object, does not go any better. Man Ray tries to help Patrick with his heavy box, but Patrick continually drops it onto Man Ray's feet. Fed up, Man Ray angrily asks Patrick what is inside, which turns out to be more wallets. Man Ray takes his rage out on Patrick, so SpongeBob tickles him yet again, but this only drives Man Ray to slam Patrick harder for his stupidity.\nSpongeBob's third lesson is hijacked by an injured Patrick, who gives Man Ray a random question as an excuse to tickle him further and get revenge. SpongeBob tries to take back the button, and as they fight over it, they accidentally break it. The belt's tickling increases exponentially, giving Man Ray no choice but to genuinely plead to be released. SpongeBob and Patrick happily do so, thinking Man Ray has now been rehabilitated. After catching his breath, however, Man Ray steals a power glove, zaps the two, and runs away.\nAfter realizing Man Ray is still evil, SpongeBob and Patrick don their Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy costumes and use the invisible boatmobile to catch up with Man Ray. They try to use the Orb of Confusion against him, but wind up becoming confused themselves. With nothing left in his way, Man Ray attempts to rob a bank. To his bewilderment, he finds the feeling of being tickled has not left him despite the belt being removed and, having legitimately lost the motivation to antagonize others, decides instead to merely open a checking account.\nMan Ray then turns off the Orb of Confusion and tells SpongeBob that the lessons have indeed changed him for the better. He presents his helmet to them and takes his leave. SpongeBob is overjoyed that they saved the day like their heroes, but Patrick remains in a dazed stupor, even with the Orb turned off and SpongeBob tries to get him to snap out of it, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Squirrel Jokes", "completion": "As the episode starts, the Krusty Krab has begun a nightly event called the \"Komedy Krab,\" featuring some of Bikini Bottom's best comedians. SpongeBob's chance to take the stage arrives, but his planned job-centered routine, featuring weak jokes about mundane topics such as salt, tomatoes, and forks, does not go over well. As the hecklers jeer, SpongeBob tries to make a witty observation, anything to get a laugh. He notices Sandy's buck teeth and starts joking about them, which earns chuckles from the audience. SpongeBob begins telling more \"squirrel jokes\" about how smelly and stupid squirrels supposedly are. The entire crowd roars with laughter, all except Sandy. After his act, Sandy confronts SpongeBob backstage and tells him that his jokes are hurtful, but he insists that it is just an act and assures her that \"Everyone knows you're the smartest creature in Bikini Bottom.\"\nThe next day, it turns out that everyone has taken the jokes to heart and either avoids or ridicules Sandy. She talks with SpongeBob again on the next night of the Komedy Krab, explaining how the jokes are affecting her public image, and she asks him to use some of his other jokes instead. Fearing his original jokes will not cut the mustard, SpongeBob gives it a shot anyway, but to no avail: the crowd wants squirrel jokes. SpongeBob quietly leaves the stage, seemingly for good. In the next moment, he bursts back on stage with an epiphany, fake buck teeth and a stereotypical Southern accent, resuming the squirrel jokes with aplomb.\nAfter the performance, SpongeBob finds a note from Sandy, stating that she has finally realized how funny his jokes are and to come to her treedome to celebrate. When he visits her, however, Sandy looks and acts exactly as his jokes make her out to be: an idiotic, clueless yokel.\nSandy has SpongeBob literally glued to his seat so he will not fall off and removes his water helmet to serve as a vase for the flowers. When SpongeBob starts to dehydrate, he begs for water, so Sandy pops a hose in his mouth to fill him up. Only after SpongeBob has expanded to fill every inch of the treedome does he promise to quit telling squirrel jokes.\nAt the following Komedy Krab event, SpongeBob tells a single, toned-down squirrel joke. He then springboards into making fun of everyone else, including sponges, fish, and crabs. The crowd jovially laughs at themselves. SpongeBob and Sandy give each other thumbs up, affirming their restored friendship, as SpongeBob jokes the night away as he prepares to joke about starfish, ending the episode."}
{"prompt": "Pressure", "completion": "As the episode begins, Sandy and SpongeBob are peacefully watching the clouds. SpongeBob spies one cloud that looks like a flower, but Sandy points out they all look like flowers all the time. While they relax, they discuss hypothetically climbing the nearby Coral Cliff, until they each casually mention that they would obviously win anyway, due to their respective land and sea based abilities. They decide to have a race and Sandy takes a head start. Despite his efforts to catch up, SpongeBob loses and challenges Sandy to another race to the Krusty Krab, taking the same head start as Sandy and winning.\nUpset at SpongeBob's victory, Sandy boasts of the superiority of land creatures to sea creatures, listing the many skills and abilities that she claims sea creatures lack. SpongeBob, joined by Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs, point out things that Sandy cannot do, such as breathing underwater. She then decides to tear off her suit and shatter her helmet. Soon enough, the strain proves too much and Sandy is forced to use a pickle jar as a makeshift air helmet.\nTo settle the issue, Sandy challenges the group to the reverse: going up on dry land for one minute, which they declare an easy feat. Once they reach the shore of the local island, they lose confidence. Unwilling to let her win, they resolve to charge up to the surface and end up finding the land enjoyable. They even take the time to chat up a pair of native seagulls.\nAfter the minute passes, Sandy lets go of her pride and heads up herself to congratulate the group. To her horror, she discovers her friends being chased and mauled by the seagulls, and attacks the birds to save them.\nThe episode ends with the quintet back on the ocean floor. The two sides come to the realization that everyone, sea and land creature alike, is good at something, even if no one is good at everything. SpongeBob and Sandy apologize to each other, and the group gives a cheer in honor of feeling sorry for themselves. Meanwhile, the now defeated and plucked seagulls, in a sorry state of their own, halfheartedly join in before the episode closes."}
{"prompt": "The Smoking Peanut", "completion": "As the episode opens, it is the annual \"Free Day\" at the Bikini Bottom Zoo, and Mr. Krabs helps himself to anything he can get his claws on. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick go to Oyster Stadium to see Clamu the giant oyster perform tricks. Unfortunately, as they enter the arena, they find Clamu is sleeping. Patrick prepares to leave, but SpongeBob tries to wake Clamu up by throwing a peanut at her, followed by her yelling loudly. SpongeBob calls Patrick back in anticipation of the show, only for Clamu to thrash around and attack the zookeepers, crying inconsolably all the while.\nAfter being questioned by one of the zoo attendants, SpongeBob and Patrick leave the park. SpongeBob feels very guilty and thinks that he caused the incident. Patrick decides to investigate the crime, determined to discover the culprit of Clamu's distress. At home, SpongeBob laments what he's done, but tells himself that the incident will soon blow over. But when he turns on the TV, the oyster incident is the top news story. The Realistic Fish Head reports that Clamu's sobs are so powerful that they can be heard all around the world (even above the surface).\nWith his guilt growing, SpongeBob goes to Squidward and Sandy for advice, but just like Patrick, both are concerned with finding and punishing the culprit. To make matters worse, Patrick reveals that he found an incriminating bag of peanuts left near SpongeBob's home, stating that he is getting close to solving the mystery.\nEventually, policemen enter SpongeBob's house and question him on the incident. SpongeBob admits to everything they ask him, but instead of arresting him, they conclude from their evidence that Patrick is the culprit, and drive away with him. SpongeBob is shocked at what has happened to his friend, and dashes after the car.\nPatrick is taken to Oyster Stadium, where he is chained to a platform in the middle of Clamu's enclosure and vengefully pelted with peanuts by the angry audience for his supposed crime. Unwilling to let Patrick take the blame, SpongeBob arrives at the stadium and asks everyone to stop. He finally confesses to having thrown the peanut, apologizing to Clamu, Patrick and the people of Bikini Bottom. The fish in the audience, upon hearing this confession, refuse to accept his apology, somehow conclude that he is Patrick's accomplice, and decide to throw peanuts at both of them. Before they can, however, a zookeeper (possibly the one from earlier) stops them, announcing that he has captured the real culprit—Mr. Krabs, much to SpongeBob, Patrick and everyone's shock.\nThe zookeeper also reveals that the true cause of Clamu's distress was not the thrown peanut, but that Mr. Krabs stole her pearl while she was asleep. The zookeeper returns the pearl to Clamu. To everyone's surprise, the pearl turns out to be an egg, hatching into a baby oyster. Having been reunited with her offspring, Clamu finally calms herself down. With the truth of the crime finally solved, SpongeBob and Patrick's names are cleared. The crowd is moved at the touching scene before turning to angrily glare at Mr. Krabs. Rather than admitting what he did was wrong, Mr. Krabs makes a pathetic excuse that it is Free Day, and is buried in a pile of peanuts the audience throws at him, much to his discomfort, as the episode concludes."}

Suddenly, a giant anchor crashes into SpongeBob's house, which SpongeBob naïvely believes to be a \"baby\" that came from the sky. He then alerts Squidward, who explains that it is merely a giant anchor while Patrick comes up and has the same stupid conclusion of the anchor being a baby. Squidward ceases their idiotic talk and tells them to get lost on the anchor. Suddenly, the anchor shifts, crashing into Squidward's house as well. An annoyed Squidward begins climbing the anchor's rope to complain to the owner about dropping his anchor in the wrong place, with SpongeBob and Patrick following behind him.\nThey find out that the anchor was dropped from the Flying Dutchman's ship. As the trio investigates the ship, the Flying Dutchman emerges from his cabin, terrifying Squidward. Unperturbed and oblivious, SpongeBob tells the Dutchman of Squidward's intentions to complain to him, earning Squidward a scorching. The Dutchman prepares to do the same to SpongeBob and Patrick, and they attempt to jump overboard but land back on the ship every time they try. The Dutchman explains to them that for setting foot on his ghost ship, they shall be forced to work as his ghostly crew for all eternity.\nSquidward proceeds to complain about this, so the annoyed Dutchman tosses him into the Fly of Despair, a zipper-like portal leading to a chaotic dimension. Watching their screaming friend disappear in the unknown realm, SpongeBob and Patrick are frightened into submission, helping the Dutchman in his quest to terrorize the citizens of Bikini Bottom. However, the pair's idea of terror proves incompatible with the Dutchman's, so the ghost reveals that they won't be his crew. SpongeBob asks if they will be released, but the Dutchman states his true nature of informing them that they will be eaten as their reward. Locked in their room, SpongeBob and Patrick's only avenue of escape is the dreaded \"perfume department.\" Surviving this ordeal, they manage to steal the Flying Dutchman's dining sock, which they overheard that he cannot eat without.\nThe Flying Dutchman catches the two as they try to escape. However, he is unable to hurt them without damaging his sock. Therefore, SpongeBob and the Dutchman begin fighting over the sock until the elastic threatens to give. The Flying Dutchman decides to grant them three wishes in exchange for the sock's safe return. Patrick wishes he knew about this earlier, thus setting the clock back one minute and using up the first wish. Although initially irritated, SpongeBob, in his excitement, wishes that Squidward was with them. Squidward, who managed to pass through the Fly of Despair and arrive safely home, is immediately transported back to the Dutchman's ship, in which the two see he is still alive, realizing that he escaped from the Fly of Despair. The trio begins arguing over who shall get the last wish until the Dutchman uses his method of choice, which he calls his \"mystic other-worldly powers,\" to decide (which is actually the eeny-meenie-minie-mo method).\nSpongeBob is chosen to receive the last wish, and so he defeats the Flying Dutchman by wishing that he turns into a vegetarian. Pronto, he does as punishment for his true colors and SpongeBob and the others are transported in front of a familiar-looking pineapple, but before they could celebrate the Flying Dutchman's defeat, they soon realize that they have been turned into fruit and are chased by the Flying Dutchman who is now a hippie around his ship that is now a hippie van with a sail while the episode finishes.\nPatchy returns to greet the audience. After a totally random outburst in which he tells the audience to walk the plank, he announces that they are going to read a fan letter. Unfortunately, Potty shows up, adorned with a burning fuse from an unplanned explosives stunt. Potty and Patchy are blown up and the latter decides to close the show."}
{"prompt": "Gary Takes a Bath", "completion": "As the episode begins, the clock is ticking and SpongeBob knows it is time for Gary's bath, but as usual, the snail does not want to take it. SpongeBob, wary of the battle he is in for, tries various tricks/methods he learned from his family to get Gary into the tub.\nFirst, he throws a ball to the bathroom and tells Gary to fetch. However, it is a Boomerang Pet Ball, so it comes right back. Next, he straps a bomb to his own chest and tells Gary that it will explode if he doesn't take a bath. Gary doesn't move and, unfortunately, the bomb's not fake.\nSpongeBob's next strategy is hypnotizing Gary by sending subliminal messages into his brain, but the disturbing imagery doesn't help. He tries calling a French restaurant, but he can't understand the receiver's accent.\nNext, SpongeBob plays leapfrog with Gary and throws him towards the bathtub, but misses and breaks Gary's shell. He tries to play leapfrog once more with the bandaged Gary, but receives a hard knock on the head with a cane. He then tries to bribe Gary saying he will give a dollar to the next person who takes a bath, but out of nowhere, Mr. Krabs shows up in a mobile bathtub and snatches the dollar. A dance routine and a fake treasure hunt leading into the bathtub (as his most powerful method of sending Gary to the bath) also fail, as do his attempts to physically force Gary in.\nGetting angry, SpongeBob decides that if he cannot bring Gary to the water, he will simply have to bring the water to Gary. SpongeBob loads himself up with water and tries to spray it at Gary, who swiftly dodges every shot. Outside, he corners the latter in a tree and climbs up, unloading his ammo at what he presumes to be Gary.\nAt first, SpongeBob fears the force of his water jet tore off Gary's skin, but realizes he only sprayed a gramophone playing a record of meowing. The real Gary then steals SpongeBob's ladder, leaving him stuck on top of the tree, saying that he is not the boss of him, and he does not have to take orders from him. Then, SpongeBob notices Gary sneaking towards a mud puddle. He gives him a three-second count to get away from the mud puddle. However, he causes SpongeBob to fall out of the tree into the mud himself. SpongeBob is then forced to take the bath under Gary's supervision instead, ending the episode."}
{"prompt": "Welcome to the Chum Bucket", "completion": "During closing time at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that he is off to play cards against Plankton. He is shocked that Mr. Krabs would risk losing anything to an unscrupulous character like Plankton. Mr. Krabs confidently explains to SpongeBob that Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom by losing all the card games every Thursday night for fifteen years.\nThe next morning, however, Mr. Krabs sadly informs SpongeBob that he lost, and the wager of the card game from the previous night has been SpongeBob's employment, because Mr. Krabs bet his contract. SpongeBob initially thinks that Mr. Krabs is joking, and tries to enter the Krusty Krab, but Mr. Krabs stops him and tells SpongeBob that he no longer works there. A shocked Squidward runs out to confirm the news. A gleeful Plankton arrives to spirit SpongeBob away to the Chum Bucket, all the while laughing and gloating at Krabs' defeat. At the Chum Bucket, Plankton cruelly orders SpongeBob to make him a Krabby Patty immediately and threatens to remove SpongeBob's brain and put it in a robot version of the sponge if he refuses to obey Plankton's order.\nHowever, SpongeBob finds himself unable to work in the Chum Bucket's cold, laboratory-like kitchen, which Plankton notices and starts considering putting his brain in the robot; Karen warns him said idea never works and suggests to Plankton that he must show SpongeBob compassion and understanding. This way, he will give Plankton what he wants. Plankton takes Karen's advice and goes to great lengths to improve SpongeBob's working conditions, eventually converting the Chum Bucket kitchen into an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen. As time goes on, however, SpongeBob begins to catch on to Plankton's ruse, and decides to pull a trick of his own, turning his humble requests into increasingly selfish demands, eventually refusing Plankton's order altogether.\nAfter being fed up with SpongeBob's bratty attitude and neglecting to control his temper, Plankton takes out SpongeBob's brain and implants it in the robot, confident that this will now have his order fulfilled. The SpongeBob Robot, however, still refuses to make Plankton a Krabby Patty, and Plankton breaks down, finally having enough. Just as Mr. Krabs is about to close the Krusty Krab for good, a crying Plankton comes over and begs him to take SpongeBob back, saying that he cannot stand him anymore. Mr. Krabs quickly hides the closed sign and initially refuses, but Plankton begs him and his enemy accepts while asking for money and Plankton gladly complies while admitting that he cheated on the card game so he could take SpongeBob away from him. Mr. Krabs then flings a happy-crying Plankton back to his restaurant.\nAfterwards, SpongeBob's brain has been restored, and Mr. Krabs welcomes him back and encourages him to get back to cooking. SpongeBob fools Mr. Krabs that he still does not feel like working, but when SpongeBob is given one tense glare from Mr. Krabs, he quickly changes his tune saying \"I mean, I'm working all day for free, my treat!\" A satisfied Mr. Krabs finishes the episode replying \"That's what I thought you said.\" \n ‣ Oyster Girls - Robert Alexander White [Title card]\n ‣ Danger Zone - Mike Sunderland [\"Plankton?!\"]\n ‣ Spanish Ladies (B) - Robin Jeffrey, Tim Laycock [\"Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom.\"]\n ‣ Botany Bay (b) - Robert Alexander White [Krabs crying the next morning]\n • Idea Vibe - Nicolas Carr [SpongeBob laughs]\n ‣ Botany Bay (b) - Robert Alexander White [\"I'm afraid you don't work here anymore.\"]\n ‣ Like Strange - Kenny Graham [\"I'm afraid he's not joking.\"]\n ‣ Finger of Fear - Fredric Bayco [SpongeBob put in a cage]\n ‣ Hercule Poirot - Gerhard Trede [SpongeBob at the Chum Bucket]\n ◦ This Grill is Not a Home - Eban Schletter, Paul Tibbitt\n ‣ Zelle 501 - Gerhard Trede [\"All these tears?

{"prompt": "Frankendoodle", "completion": "As the episode begins on the ocean's surface, an artist in a rowboat sketches feverishly. Unfortunately, his pencil slips from his hand and falls into the sea. As the artist cries out in horror, the French Narrator states the first rule of the artist at sea: \"Always bring a spare pencil.\"\nDown on the ocean floor, SpongeBob and Patrick are playing \"Rock-Paper-Scissors\" using bubbles when the pencil suddenly lands in between them. SpongeBob and Patrick, at first terrified of the large artifact, start to doodle with it. They soon come to discover that whatever they draw with the pencil is brought to life, and thus dub it the \"Magic Pencil.\"\nSpongeBob soon draws \"DoodleBob,\" a sketch version of himself intended to fool Squidward. However, DoodleBob beats Squidward up and steals the Magic Pencil, going off to wreak havoc across the seascape. SpongeBob eventually turns the tide of battle and uses the pencil's eraser to rub out DoodleBob.\nUnbeknownst to SpongeBob and Patrick, a lone arm remains, and in the night it steals the pencil back from SpongeBob and redraws its body. DoodleBob then attempts to erase SpongeBob, and during the struggle, the pencil is snapped in half. DoodleBob has the eraser and SpongeBob has the point. However, DoodleBob sharpens his half and SpongeBob accidentally flicks his pencil out of the window at Squidward's head. DoodleBob corners SpongeBob in front of a bookshelf, but steps on a sheet of paper and finds his foot absorbed into it.\nSeizing his chance, SpongeBob closes DoodleBob in a book, in which the doodle is finally happy. The page with DoodleBob is then framed on a wall. Patrick arrives and listens to SpongeBob's musings on the nature of his doppelgänger, taking SpongeBob's photograph for the doodle. They decide to send the magic pencil back from where it came, shooting it back up to the distraught artist.\nWith his drawing instrument returned, the artist excitedly prepares to begin a new masterpiece, but when the pencil meets the canvas, the lead snaps. As the episode ends with the artist crying out once more, the French Narrator states the second rule of the artist at sea: \"Always bring a pencil sharpener.\""}
{"prompt": "The Secret Box", "completion": "As the episode begins, SpongeBob runs towards Patrick's house, ready to go jellyfishing. Patrick says he will go with him, but must put away his \"secret box\" first. SpongeBob tries to peek inside, but Patrick refuses to let him see. SpongeBob entices Patrick by sharing his own secrets, but this only convinces Patrick to keep his secret box even more closely guarded. SpongeBob tries to distract him with many of his own secret possessions, but Patrick only pays attention to his own box.\nAs Patrick explains the lengths he must go to keep his box safe, he fails to notice SpongeBob sneaking off with it, giddily preparing to look. Patrick stops him just in time and struggles with SpongeBob over the box. The sight of SpongeBob's arms popping off while still desperately clinging to the box disgusts Patrick, making him question the validity of their membership in the Best Friends Forever Club. He threatens to end their friendship if SpongeBob continues trying to look at his secret. SpongeBob begs Patrick for his forgiveness and promises to respect Patrick's right to secrecy, and they remain friends.\nThat night, SpongeBob cannot sleep, still thinking about Patrick's secret box and wondering about its contents. He convinces himself that sneaking into Patrick's house while he is asleep would prevent Patrick from getting upset and he will be able to look at the secret without feeling guilty. Despite Gary's admonitions, SpongeBob puts his plan into action, pulling on a silk stocking for a mask and slipping under Patrick's rock.\nInside, the box lays in full view on Patrick's nightstand. Trying to tiptoe across a floor covered in potato chips, SpongeBob fears waking Patrick with every step. Finally making it to the bedside, SpongeBob reaches for the box but Patrick sleepily grabs hold of it. SpongeBob, conveniently cube-shaped, gently slips himself in place of the box just as Patrick attempts to take something from it, yanking SpongeBob's tongue in the process. Patrick then places SpongeBob next to him on the bed, allowing SpongeBob to get back onto the floor. As he prepares to leave, SpongeBob trips on his shoelace and begins crashing and bouncing around the rock in a cacophony of noise, culminating in slamming against the wall and breaking a framed photo of him and Patrick in half. Despite all of this, Patrick remains fast asleep.\nSpongeBob quietly remarks how heavy a sleeper Patrick is, which causes Patrick to finally wake up and catch the masked SpongeBob with the box. Thinking him to be the \"Clam Burglar,\" Patrick prepares to assault him with a pillow until SpongeBob confirms his identity with his Best Friends Forever ring. In shock and distraught, Patrick declares their friendship to be over. Immediately afterwards, Patrick changes his mind and finally allows SpongeBob look inside the box.\nSpongeBob eagerly opens the box, only to find a piece of string. Thanking Patrick for letting him look, SpongeBob heads home, laughing at how he should not have been surprised. Alone once more, Patrick ponders alone the true secret nature of the box: when the string is pulled, a secret compartment opens and reveals an embarrassing picture of SpongeBob at a Christmas party, and Patrick laughs at it, joking a Merry Christmas to SpongeBob, now two houses out of earshot, thus ending the episode."}
{"prompt": "Band Geeks", "completion": "The episode begins one day, Squidward was playing his clarinet but was disturbed by a doorbell which is a doctor who arrived at his house after mistaking his clarinet playing for a \"dying animal,\" he receives a call from his former high school classmate and rival Squilliam Fancyson. The rich, successful, and very smug Squilliam informs Squidward that he is the leader of a band that is supposed to play the prestigious Bubble Bowl the following week, but he will be unable to attend. He gives Squidward a backhanded offer to replace him, correctly suspecting that Squidward does not have his own band. However, Squidward defiantly insists that he does have a band and accepts the offer, before posting flyers around Bikini Bottom looking for people to join his band.\nOn the first night of rehearsals, Squidward brings his rented instruments to a practice hall filled with townspeople. Upon discovering that none of his prospective bandmates have any previous musical experience, Squidward teaches them the basics. Unfortunately, the night doesn't end well as Squidward gets pinned to the wall by drumsticks the players mistook as mouth instruments while Sandy beats up Patrick and shoves his body through the bore of a trombone after he kicks her leg.\nThings do not get any better during the second day of training; while practicing a march through the street two flag twirlers are killed when they spin their flags too fast, causing them to fly into the air and crash into a passing blimp. On the third day, Squidward checks on Plankton's harmonica solo, though he becomes exhausted and collapses from running back and forth between the holes since the harmonica is much bigger than him.\nOn the fourth and final day of practice, Squidward says that while none of them have made any improvement since the beginning, he suggests that everyone play loud so they will be good. Unfortunately, they take this theory a bit too literally as they play so loud and badly that the windows of the practice hall break, and Squidward's face is deformed beyond recognition, prompting him to change the plan to playing extremely quietly so nobody will hear them. The band members then begin to insult each other, and despite Squidward attempting to quell the rising tensions, a mass brawl breaks out that damages most of the instruments. When the clock hits 10:00 PM, the fighting ends and everyone starts to head home.\nSquidward stops them at the entrance and expresses his disappointment at their lack of progress and for not taking his dream seriously. After Squidward leaves in distress at his failure, a remorseful SpongeBob asks the townspeople to think about all of the times Squidward came through for them. Despite drawing a blank, they are convinced enough to give practice one more try for Squidward's sake, with SpongeBob taking command as the conductor.\nThe day of the performance arrives and Squidward prepares to finalize his band's cancellation, only to find Squilliam waiting for him at the entrance of the Bubble Bowl. Squidward tries to explain that his band can no longer play as they all died in a marching accident, but they suddenly appear behind him in full uniform and with their instruments at ready, forcing Squidward to go through with the performance.\nAs everyone enters a huge glass dome, Squidward bemoans the humiliation that he is certain is awaiting him. The dome rises into a football stadium filled with human fans. Squidward, still fearing that the performance will be a disaster, nervously begins conducting. But to his and Squilliam's astonishment, the band performs a rock ballad called \"Sweet Victory\" and it turns out to be a tremendous success. As the crowd sways in awe and Squilliam faints in shock, Squidward throws away his baton and leaps into the air in triumph, ending the episode."}
{"prompt": "Graveyard Shift", "completion": "One night, the Krusty Krab staff prepares for its 8:00 PM closing, which comes none too soon for Squidward. However, a customer walks up to the door and attempts to make an order. Squidward smugly informs him that they are closed, and the customer prepares to take his money elsewhere. Realizing the financial potential of a late-night shift, Mr. Krabs tears apart the \"Closed\" sign and, against Squidward's wishes, proclaims the Krusty Krab to now be open 24 hours a day. Mr. Krabs then promptly leaves his employees while SpongeBob is overjoyed at this prospect and, as the night goes on, takes pleasure in the tasks he had no time to do during the day. When the time comes to take out the trash, however, he shows some trepidation towards the darkness outside. After going outside screaming to throw away the trash, he comes back in and calls it an easy task.\nSquidward, sensing SpongeBob's fear, weaves him a terrifying tale on the spot of a \"hash-slinging slasher,\" a clumsy Krusty Krab fry cook from years past who accidentally chopped off his hand and had it replaced with a rusty spatula. Due to fatally being run over by a bus and posthumous termination, the horrific specter returns every Tuesday night (though Squidward only put this detail in the story when SpongeBob told him that it was Tuesday) to exact vengeance on all who reside in the restaurant. Squidward goes on to explain the three signs of the ghost's return: the lights flickering on and off, the phone ringing with no one at the other end, and the arrival of the bus that had run the fry cook over. Squidward then laughs at SpongeBob's shrieks of fright, but when SpongeBob continues screaming, an annoyed Squidward tells SpongeBob that he was joking and that the story is not true.\n3:00 AM soon arrives and the restaurant is now completely devoid of customers or any other signs of life besides SpongeBob and Squidward. Whilst contending with SpongeBob's diligent ceiling washing, Squidward expresses bafflement at the idea of the Krusty Krab being open 24 hours a day, wondering who would want a Krabby Patty at that time. (Ironically, a cutaway gag shows Patrick excitedly waking up at this hour specifically to eat a Krabby Patty.)\nSuddenly, the lights begin flickering, though Squidward initially thinks SpongeBob is doing it in a failed attempt to scare him. After realizing that nobody is touching the light switch, Squidward then blames the faulty electrical wiring, as the restaurant was not built to run 24 hours a day. The next moment, the phone rings but remains silent when Squidward answers. This time, SpongeBob thinks that Squidward is trying to scare him, but the latter denies this and becomes more nervous as these are two of the three signs that supposedly signal the arrival of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. While trying to remember the third sign, a bus pulls up to the Krusty Krab, even though the buses supposedly do not run so late. Its lone departing passenger is a shadow-covered figure with what appears to be glowing red eyes, wielding a spatula. Fearing it to be the Hash-Slinging Slasher, Squidward starts to freak out whit SpongeBob thinks Squidward is dressed up across the street to entertain him because he likes him. However, Squidward tells SpongeBob the flaws in his theory. The first is he hates him and the second is how it's impossible for him to be the ghost when he is standing right next to him. Hearing this, SpongeBob starts to panic now.\nBelieving the events they witness to be supernatural, a frightened SpongeBob and Squidward say their final words as the figure approaches the counter. When the figure enters the light, however, he turns out to be just an ordinary person holding a spatula in a fully intact hand, which had been covered by his sleeve. He asks for a job application and reveals that he was the one who called earlier but hung up before speaking because he was nervous. Relieved, SpongeBob asks the applicant if he has any references, though Squidward notes that this turn of events does not explain the lights flickering.\nAs if to answer his question, the lights flicker again, revealing the culprit to be none other than the vampire Nosferatu. They casually tease him, as if this is a well-known habit to Krusty Krab staff and clients alike. Smiling at the trio mischievously, he flicks the lights off once more, cutting to black and ending the episode."}
{"prompt": "Krusty Love", "completion": "The episode begins on one day at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs' keen sense of smell informs him that his cash register has a deficit of one penny. As he cries over his loss, SpongeBob reassures him that losing one penny is not that big of a deal. Mr. Krabs, however, sees that money as a very big deal, considering all that it can buy, and proclaims that nothing in the world matters more. Nothing, that is, except for the beautiful visage of Mrs. Puff he suddenly spies.\nSpongeBob tells him who she is and offers to introduce the two of them. Despite Mr. Krabs' pleas that he is too old for love, SpongeBob brings him over to Mrs. Puff's table. However, Mr. Krabs becomes extremely nervous and his attempts to communicate with her result in him talking in unintelligible speech as well as making strange body movements. SpongeBob steps in and after a series of mistakes, he tells Mrs. Puff that Mr. Krabs is trying to ask her out on a date. Surprisingly, she finds Mr. Krabs to have quite a way with words and accepts his offer, much to his joy.\nThat night, Mr. Krabs takes Mrs. Puff to a fancy restaurant and showers her with lavish services: foot rubs in between courses, caricatures, live music from a scuba diver, and transportation in a limousine. Mr. Krabs then receives a bill and is outraged that he is being charged $100. The waiter apologizes and hands him the proper bill. Upon seeing his actual bill, a horrified Mr. Krabs screams so loudly it causes the glass bottle that the restaurant is contained within to explode, which ends up costing him $100,000.\nBack at home, Mr. Krabs sobs hysterically as SpongeBob questions him on how he could spend such a ridiculous amount of money in one night. Mr. Krabs says that in his infatuated state, he couldn't help himself. He starts to worry about how much money he'll lose on his date the following day, then gets an idea: he gives SpongeBob his wallet and tells him to come along on the date to prevent him from spending any more money.\nThe next day arrives, and Mr. Krabs decides the most cost-effective activity would be to take Mrs. Puff to the park. But after arriving at Mrs. Puff's house, Mr. Krabs commands SpongeBob to buy Mrs. Puff some flowers and a box of chocolates, as well as a large amount of increasingly expensive and unnecessary things. But each time SpongeBob returns with the requested purchase, Mr. Krabs gets mad and scolds him for breaking their agreement. Eventually, a tired and fed up SpongeBob calls him out on his hypocrisy, to which Mr. Krabs laments that he does not want to lose Mrs. Puff, who is still waiting to go to the park as she sits upon the mountain of gifts and sobs again.\nFeeling bad, SpongeBob leaves and comes back with a washing machine that Mr. Krabs supposedly asked for. But the latter once again scolds SpongeBob for spending his money, and after he makes a snide comment and wonders whether Mrs. Puff will need a dryer as well, SpongeBob has got something to say.\nFinally having enough, SpongeBob snaps, then badmouths off Mr. Krabs for his behavior, before angrily leaving the area. A shocked Mrs. Puff walks up to an even more shocked Mr. Krabs and calmly tells him that for her part, she does not feel comfortable accepting so many such expensive gifts, preferring to \"go Dutch.\" She then hands Mr. Krabs some money, while calling him sweet and kisses him, leaving him utterly love-struck, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Procrastination", "completion": "The episode starts at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, where SpongeBob's class receives an assignment for an 800-word essay on what not to do at a stoplight, due the following morning. SpongeBob cannot wait to get started and, upon arriving home, prepares his materials and workspace. However, he has trouble thinking of what to write, and gets distracted by seeing his friends playing outside.\nTime passes as SpongeBob tries to create the right mood for writing. He does some calisthenics, feeds Gary, cleans his kitchen, and takes copious breaks in between. It eventually becomes clear that SpongeBob is only looking for excuses to avoid the essay. Even Patrick points it out when SpongeBob calls to chat with him in the middle of the night.\nWhile wasting more time deciding on the proper bread to use for making himself a sandwich, SpongeBob hears a knock at the door and rushes to greet the mailman delivering a package. When SpongeBob attempts to engage in small talk, the mailman cuts him off and suggests that SpongeBob has an essay to write. Suspicious, SpongeBob slowly heads back inside to find a newscaster on TV reporting on SpongeBob's unfinished essay. He soon discovers that many of his possessions, now suddenly alive, are conspiring against him to prevent the completion of his work. Their interference results in the immolation of his house which, also suddenly alive, begs SpongeBob as it burns to, \"Stop wasting time.\"\nFinally waking up and realizing much of his procrastination was part of a nightmare, SpongeBob looks first at his woefully incomplete essay, then at the clock, marking five minutes before class time. In desperation, he suddenly realizes that everything he did (or imagined doing) up to that point was something that should not be done at a stoplight, and so he quickly writes it all down to fulfill the 800-word requirement.\nExcitedly bringing the finished essay to school, SpongeBob finds the classroom empty. Mrs. Puff arrives and explains that she tried to call SpongeBob to give him an update. Due to a teachers' convention she must attend, Mrs. Puff has canceled the assignment and will instead take the class on a field trip the following week to see a stoplight. Left behind with his grin frozen in place (when he realized that he crammed in vain to complete his assignment), SpongeBob then rips his essay in half before he splits himself in half, ending the episode."}

In distress, Patrick informs SpongeBob that the following day is Starfish Day, and his parents are planning to visit. Patrick sadly reveals that his parents consider him to be quite unintelligent, and he can't bring himself to face their condescension. Patrick and SpongeBob come up with a plan: SpongeBob will act like an idiot so Patrick's parents will see their son as comparatively smarter, which Patrick readily accepts.\nThe next day, a married starfish couple arrives at Patrick's house, and Patrick thinks they are his parents. Patrick shows them inside his house, where they proceed to treat him like a child after he brings them drinks. Outside, after Gary questions SpongeBob about pretending to be stupid and SpongeBob wonders what would go wrong, he soon makes his entrance, wearing his karate helmet to look stupid and acting in a strange manner. As Patrick's parents look upon SpongeBob's peculiar antics, they start to give Patrick a lot more credit for keeping his supposedly stupid friend in check.\nAt dinner, as SpongeBob's shenanigans escalate, Patrick begins to lob personal insults at him for his parents' amusement. This annoys SpongeBob so much that he brings Patrick to the kitchen to talk. As it turns out, Patrick has begun to forget that SpongeBob is only pretending to be an idiot, now believing that SpongeBob really is stupid. SpongeBob confronts Patrick in the kitchen over forgetting the plan, but Patrick refuses to believe him and assumes he was only imagining the whole thing. Patrick then bets SpongeBob can impress his parents better than him, and SpongeBob vows to prove so and gives Patrick his helmet.\nSpongeBob confesses to Patrick's parents that he is not really an idiot and was only behaving like one so that they would appreciate Patrick more. This also fails, as Patrick's parents think that Patrick coached SpongeBob into mimicking basic skills such as talking in complete sentences and even math. Their derision and laughter bring SpongeBob to the limits of his patience, driving him to scream at the top of his lungs and crash through the wall in Patrick's house to get out.\nWith no \"idiot\" present, Patrick's parents commend him on his newfound intelligence, and accidentally reveal themselves to be two random starfish named Janet and Marty. Patrick, confused and outraged, realizes that they are not his real parents, and demands to know who these strangers are. All of a sudden, Squidward comes to Patrick's house with two other starfish, who have been asking him for Patrick all day which has been driving Squidward nuts. Patrick happily recognizes the starfish couple as his real parents, and they are happy to see him as well, especially with his pants on. Janet and Marty then remember that they don't even have a son, and they leave Patrick to share a laugh with his real family, just as the rock slams shut on top of them while the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Sailor Mouth", "completion": "The episode begins when the Krusty Krab reaches closing time and SpongeBob is about to leave, but is ordered by Mr. Krabs to take the trash on his way out. When SpongeBob goes around to the back of the restaurant, he peruses some of the dumpster writing, eventually finding one passage in particular reading \"Krabs is a...\" As SpongeBob reads the last word, which is censored via a dolphin sound, a nearby garbage man is disgusted at his usage of the word to the point where he asks SpongeBob if he kisses his mother with that mouth. Confused, SpongeBob repeats this new word to the arriving Patrick, who informs that it is a \"sentence enhancer\" used in refined conversation. They begin to repeat it to themselves and use it in conversations.\nThe next day, SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab using the word and the customers are shocked, horrified and disgusted. SpongeBob greets Patrick with their new word and he does the same, to the chagrin of an old man who voices it by stating he thought the Krusty Krab is a restaurant not a guttermouth convention . SpongeBob then shares the word with everyone else over the intercom. The Krusty Krab customers are appalled by what they hear and leave for the sake of going somewhere where the employees don't work blue. In the bathroom, Mr. Krabs is alerted to the empty restaurant and rushes out. Squidward explains that SpongeBob and Patrick have learned a new word and SpongeBob said it to everybody in the Krusty Krab over the intercom, causing the customers to leave.\nMr. Krabs asks what SpongeBob and Patrick's new word was and Squidward explains it. Mr. Krabs sternly informs them that their new word isn’t a fancy word: it’s actually an expletive that is the eleventh of thirteen vulgar words that should never be uttered as they are all bad words. SpongeBob and Patrick wipe the expletive from their tongues and promise Mr. Krabs that they will never use it again.\nLater, at SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob and Patrick play a game of Eels and Escalators. Patrick keeps moving up escalators while SpongeBob gets sent down the eels. After losing the game, SpongeBob accidentally angrily shouts out the expletive they promised not to say. Patrick then races to the Krusty Krab to tell Mr. Krabs, while SpongeBob tries to stop him. During the chase, Patrick repeats the swear word, giving SpongeBob the excuse to tell on him instead. Thanks to Patrick's detour aboard an ice cream truck, SpongeBob reaches the Krusty Krab first and rushes to Mr. Krabs. However, SpongeBob cannot get to the point, giving Patrick time to catch up and add to the clamor. Eventually, Mr. Krabs commands them to spit out what they mean to say, which turns out to be the bad word.\nEnraged, Mr. Krabs takes SpongeBob and Patrick outside and tells them to wait. Fearing their upcoming retribution, the two friends apologize to each other and vow to strike the word permanently from their lips. Mr. Krabs returns with cans of paint for them to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint as punishment. However, he hits his foot on a rock, and in his pain, he shouts all thirteen expletives. Once SpongeBob and Patrick tally the curses, they run to Betsy Krabs' house to tell on her son while he chases after them to stop the pair. As Betsy answers the door, she is greeted by a cacophony of swearing from all three of them, causing her to faint.\nMr. Krabs reprimands SpongeBob and Patrick for using such salty language in front of his mother. However, Mama Krabs quickly regains consciousness, scolds all three for their sailor mouths, and sets them to work painting her house. After some time, she decides to reward them with some lemonade. On her way to get it, she hits her foot on a rock and shouts in pain. What they take to be a bad word, however, is actually the car horn of Old Man Jenkins' jalopy, with Jenkins greeting Betsy, giving them all a good laugh and ending the episode."}
{"prompt": "Artist Unknown", "completion": "As the episode begins, Squidward is teaching an art class at the Adult Learning Center, and cannot wait to see his new students. He opens the doors and greets a whole crowd of people, who are actually looking for the cooking class. They depart, leaving behind only one pupil: SpongeBob.\nSquidward begrudgingly starts to teach SpongeBob what he knows. He starts off by demonstrating a poorly-drawn circle on the blackboard and has SpongeBob copy it, but is shocked when SpongeBob produces a perfect circle. He demands SpongeBob show him how he did it, so SpongeBob effortlessly draws a realistic human head, erases the details, and leaves a perfect circle behind. Squidward snatches SpongeBob's paper and crumples it up, which SpongeBob then turns into an origami sculpture of himself and Squidward playing leap-frog. Squidward rips it apart, but SpongeBob simply forms the scraps into a picture of them continuing their game.\nSquidward then attempts to show off his prowess with the chisel, creating a mere pile of rubble. However, with a single stroke of his mallet, SpongeBob produces Michelangelo's David from a raw block of marble. Squidward is amazed, but out of jealousy, he scoffs at SpongeBob's masterpiece and refuses to acknowledge his talent. SpongeBob, unquestioning of his teacher's judgment, is ashamed of himself and throws himself out of class, falling into a dumpster being hauled away to the city dump, saying that he deserves it. Squidward feels a bit bad for hurting SpongeBob's feelings, but decides to shut down his class, regardless.\nImmediately after, an art collector named Monty P. Moneybags comes in, saying that he is looking for art to purchase for his new museum. Squidward shows off his own pieces to him, but Monty dislikes them all because they are all based on Squidward himself.\nHowever, he falls in love with SpongeBob's masterpiece, which Squidward takes credit for. While carrying the heavy statue to Monty's car, Squidward accidentally knocks off its head. Monty assures Squidward that he should easily be able to make another one, and that he will come back the next day to get it. Squidward, desperate for SpongeBob to make him another masterpiece, goes to the dump and convinces a depressed SpongeBob that he deserves another chance.\nUpon returning to art class, SpongeBob has unfortunately taken Squidward's prior lessons to heart, and so fails to create anything of decent quality. When he tries to chisel another marble statue, it simply collapses into a pile of rubble. Squidward goes insane with frustration and begins smashing pillars of marble. SpongeBob concludes that his artistic \"triumph\" was too much for Squidward to handle, and crashes through the wall, going back to the dump.\nThe episode ends when Monty P. Moneybags returns and, upon seeing what Squidward has produced, incredulously asks who is responsible. Squidward shifts the blame onto the janitor and angrily storms out. However, unknown to Squidward, he has made an even more beautiful and bigger rendition of David while he got angry, and Monty cries out to the janitor, \"You, sir, are the greatest artist who ever lived!\", ending the episode."}
{"prompt": "Jellyfish Hunter", "completion": "SpongeBob is out jellyfishing in Jellyfish Fields. He catches a jellyfish, gently tickles out some of its jelly, and lets it go, naming it \"Twelvy\" on its way. He then spies a very rare blue jellyfish, the only jellyfish in the field he has never been able to catch and name, thus calling him \"No Name.\" SpongeBob's attempt to catch this specimen ends in failure once again, despite having used himself like a rocket to get closer to it.\nLater, SpongeBob goes on his five-minute lunch break at the Krusty Krab and puts the fresh jellyfish jelly on a Krabby Patty. A customer notices it and asks him what it is. After SpongeBob explains that it is \"a Krabby Patty with jellyfish jelly,\" the customer is eager to try it himself, so SpongeBob provides him with a dollop. Amazed with its taste, the customer sings a song proclaiming its greatness and plops jelly on the patties of all the other customers, who enjoy it as well. Mr. Krabs comes out from his office to see what the fuss is about, and SpongeBob explains how he was sharing his jelly with the customers. Mr. Krabs at first considers tampering with the Krabby Patty recipe to be mutiny, but when the customer tells him that he will come back for lunch there every day for the rest of his life, Mr. Krabs officially puts the new Jelly Patty on the menu.\nSpongeBob is tasked to go out and gather as many jellyfish as he can. He is delighted to be paid for jellyfishing, but Mr. Krabs tells him that it is part of his free time. SpongeBob stills agrees, though he asks Mr. Krabs to keep the jellyfish comfortable while milking them for jelly. Mr. Krabs secretly states to himself that he will keep them comfortable \"in his wallet,\" hinting that he does not care for their safety. SpongeBob catches several jellyfish, with Mr. Krabs demanding more every time until Jellyfish Fields is completely deserted. SpongeBob concludes that there are no more jellyfish to catch, and begins to walk home.\nAs SpongeBob walks home, he feels that he is being followed. He turns around, mentioning that he feels like someone is trying to sell him something. The thing following him is revealed to be No Name, but he hides every time SpongeBob looks back. SpongeBob states that he is not interested in anything his hypothetical salesman is selling and rushes home. Upon arriving home, he closes the blinds of his windows in panic but soon laughs off the incident. SpongeBob then gets a strange call from No Name that only features him breathing before the call abruptly ends, with the line seemingly having been cut. Nervous, SpongeBob laughs it off as a wrong number call, but the lights go off shortly after and he laughs that off as well by stating that Gary must have forgotten to pay the electric bill. SpongeBob later sees a shadow that he believes is Gary crawling into the house and later into the kitchen, which SpongeBob thinks is a good idea as Gary would probably find food there. Shortly after, he enters the dark kitchen and sees a Jelly Patty where the moonlight is shining in from the window. He eats it at first but shortly realizes that something is extremely wrong when he finds that the patty contains blue jelly.\nNo Name shows up and SpongeBob ends up captured in a jar himself by the blue jellyfish. It then takes SpongeBob to a secret factory farm, where he discovers that Mr. Krabs is forcefully wringing every jellyfish dry to increase his bottom line, draining, harming, and possibly killing them. Realizing Mr. Krabs' unscrupulous plan, SpongeBob angrily confronts him. Mr. Krabs claims that they are having a tea party which initially distracts SpongeBob, but No Name informs him of the trick and SpongeBob declares his intention to free the jellyfish. Mr. Krabs is shocked when SpongeBob suddenly picks up a pipe wrench, but he uses it to fix the squeaky bolts on the door, much to his relief. SpongeBob tries to set the jellyfish free but is unable to open the door to their cage.\nMr. Krabs laughs and boasts of his sturdy voice-activated door that only opens when he says \"Open,\" which consequently opens the door. The freed jellyfish swarm over Mr. Krabs, who tries in vain to ride off on the bike used to power the machine before realizing it is only an exercise bike. The jellyfish then give him a mighty zap before flying off. Thoroughly charred, Mr. Krabs meekly decides to take the jelly off the menu.\nSpongeBob vows to never again let his net be used for anything except pure sports, stating that jellyfish are not meant to be kept in captivity forever. No Name gently enters his net, allowing itself to be caught. Touched, SpongeBob decides to name the jellyfish \"Friend,\" and they share a handshake that ends up stinging SpongeBob, who laughs it off nervously as his hand proceeds to swell."}
{"prompt": "The Fry Cook Games", "completion": "The episode begins at the Bikini Bottom's Fast Food Coliseum, where the 21st annual Fry Cook Games are underway. The top contenders for the gold medal have traditionally been Mr. Krabs and Plankton. This year, however, SpongeBob has been chosen to represent the Krusty Krab, and is diligently warming up to compete. Patrick wanders by and also wants to play in the games, but is shut down by SpongeBob, as only fry cooks may enter. Patrick scoffs at this, considering fry cooking to be no great feat. After a heated argument, Patrick storms off vowing to become a fry cook, while SpongeBob intensifies his workout.\nPlankton soon enters the stadium and engages in verbal fisticuffs with Mr. Krabs. Plankton reveals he has also recruited a contender to represent the Chum Bucket and calls forth a colossal giant. The giant, however, is simply an intimidation tactic, as strapped to his back is Patrick, who turns out to have been hired as fry cook for the Chum Bucket minutes prior. Now standing on equal ground, SpongeBob and Patrick each vow to defeat the other, despite feeling more hurt than angry. Mr. Krabs and Plankton fan the flames of their charges' rivalry, inciting them to show no mercy in the games.\nIn their first event, the \"Deep Fry Pole Vault,\" SpongeBob pulls off a nearly perfect jump, while Patrick only manages to scald some audience members into fish sticks. Next, during the \"Chocolate High-Dive,\" SpongeBob also does well, but Patrick is able to out-perform him with his concentration and impeccable form. The events continue, the two combatants maintaining an even score all the way to the final challenge: \"Bun Wrestling.\"\nAs the bell sounds for the fight to begin, SpongeBob and Patrick rip off their robes to reveal muscularly toned bodies before leaping up and colliding with each other midair. They go at each other in fury, their grudges driving them more than their loyalty to their restaurants. They pull off increasingly dirty moves, practically torturing one another. They eventually end up in a grapple, each straining to bring the other one down, and they're about to finish each other off, until the strain finally proves too much for their pants to take. They tear away to reveal that all along, SpongeBob and Patrick each wore underwear in the color of his best friend and they both cry and hug each other.\nMoved to tears, the two friends reconcile and agree never to fight each other again, mutually forfeiting the match and walking side by side out of the arena. This does not sit well with the spectators, Mr. Krabs or Plankton, and the managers try to get them to come back and fight again. As the episode ends with SpongeBob and Patrick leaving the arena, the latter notes that his underwear was originally white."}
{"prompt": "Squid on Strike", "completion": "After finding profits to be slightly lower than usual at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs decides to start billing his employees for doing the most normal things including talking, chewing, breathing, lollygagging, and even existing. Squidward finds this to be outrageously unfair, and he convinces SpongeBob that they should go on strike. SpongeBob, initially not knowing what it means to go on strike, is devastated when he is fired. Squidward, however, assures him that he will have his job back \"and more.\"\nSquidward starts them off by making SpongeBob throw his hat on the ground, but he couldn't do it since he refuses to let go of his own hat, making Squidward get a ticket for littering from the police. Then he makes a sign stating \"Krusty Krab Unfair,\" but SpongeBob writes his as \"Krusty Krab Funfair,\" making the restaurant more popular. Squidward then has SpongeBob memorize derogatory slogans about Mr. Krabs and the restaurant, though their meaning flies over SpongeBob's head. He draws the attention of an eager young teenager who thinks of SpongeBob as a living legend. Rather than joining him in the strike, however, he heads inside the restaurant to take SpongeBob's job.\nSquidward then attempts to give a speech to the people of Bikini Bottom, who grow so excited by his words that they build up an appetite and rush over him to eat at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs steps outside to taunt him about how beneficial the strike has been for his bottom line. Standing up for Squidward, SpongeBob turns against Mr. Krabs and tells him that they will stay on strike forever until his unfair pay deduction policy is abolished. The word \"forever\" accidentally strikes a nerve with Squidward, who grows deeply unsettled at the thought of being on a never-ending strike with SpongeBob.\nUnable to sleep with this thought, Squidward runs to the door to beg Mr. Krabs for his job back. Opening it, he is surprised to find Mr. Krabs, who begs him and SpongeBob to return, saying that he cannot stand the teenagers he hired as replacements as they are ruining the place and will not leave him alone. As they walk to the Krusty Krab together, Squidward relishes how the tables have turned and begun discussing the terms of their return with Mr. Krabs.\nMeanwhile, SpongeBob has taken the words of Squidward's speech to heart and spends the night literally dismantling the establishment that is the Krusty Krab. Squidward and Mr. Krabs soon arrive, having come to an agreement. Squidward is horrified to see the Krusty Krab in shambles, while SpongeBob stands proudly among the wreckage. When Mr. Krabs discovers his restaurant is completely destroyed, he literally falls to pieces and remarks that in order to pay for the damages, Squidward and SpongeBob will work for him forever. SpongeBob jumps in joy while realizing the true meaning of \"forever,\" while Squidward suddenly once more takes in the full meaning of it.\nOne eternity later, SpongeBob and Squidward are shown as nothing but a (literal) skeleton crew, still working at the Krusty Krab, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm", "completion": "In the middle of the night, an unseen creature lurks into Bikini Bottom and causes havoc, taking gigantic bites out of everything in sight. Soon it appears at SpongeBob's house and decimates the pineapple, and SpongeBob wakes up just in time to see the beast. The next morning at the Krusty Krab, he tells the frightened crowd of the Alaskan Bull Worm that he saw, and the townspeople corroborate his tale of woe. They all agree that they need a plan to protect themselves from this monster.\nMr. Krabs tries to take advantage of the situation and make cash by selling Krabby Patties, but he is immediately pelted with ketchup and mustard bottles by the outraged crowds, because of his greed. As everyone struggles to plan, Patrick suggests physically pushing the whole town to a safer location, but this idea is immediately shot down by Squidward. Among the other suggestions is that someone should take on the beast and that someone willing to do the job turns out to be Sandy. She shows the crowd that her tail has also been eaten by the worm, and vows to go defeat the beast to get her tail back. Nearly everyone cheers, but SpongeBob is terrified, and asks Sandy to reconsider. Sandy refuses to listen to his pleas and rushes out, so SpongeBob goes after her. The townspeople then decide, as a backup plan, to follow Patrick's suggestion and start shoving the city out of harm's way.\nSpongeBob catches up to Sandy and again tries to dissuade her from her crusade. Sandy scoffs at his fears, sure of her own strength and of the need to retrieve her tail. SpongeBob meekly informs her that he is the one who has her tail, but when she asks to see it, all he can produce is a paperclip and a piece of string. Nevertheless, he keeps trying to stop her from proceeding. Nothing he does slows her down, so he begs her not to go there, that she has no idea what she's up against. Sandy, annoyed at SpongeBob's constant worrying, commands him to agree that there is no animal too big or dangerous for her to handle.\nThey reach a large, moist cave that seems to be the lair of the worm, and against SpongeBob's protestations, Sandy heads inside to do battle with the creature. She manages to wrangle the wriggly monstrosity and tie it in a knot, proudly presenting it and her reunited tail to SpongeBob, saying she knew no worm was a match for her. However, SpongeBob timidly points out that what she is defeated is not the Alaskan Bull Worm, but rather its tongue. After contemplating the fact that the cave itself is actually the worm, Sandy sagely decides to hightail it.\nThe giant worm angrily gives chase, but even as SpongeBob and Sandy run for dear life, SpongeBob cannot help but point out he was right all along about the worm being too much for her to handle, coercing Sandy into admitting it, and she does after a while. Still needing a way to escape, Sandy takes the paperclip and string SpongeBob showed her earlier, and uses them to snag a branch of coral. She swings them out of the charging worm's path, leaving it to hurtle off a cliff. Sandy and SpongeBob congratulate themselves and head off to inform the town of the worm's defeat.\nMeanwhile, the townspeople have finished moving the city to the bottom of the cliff and give a cheer thinking it is perfect, just as the plummeting worm lands right on top of it, destroying it, and utters a pitiful \"Ouch\" as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "The Algae's Always Greener", "completion": "After failing to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula once again, Plankton decides that he is tired of eating holographic meatloaf. Believing Mr. Krabs to have a more satisfying existence, he longs to switch lives with him. Karen points out that he had conveniently invented a transmogrifier earlier, and suggests he use it. Plankton takes her advice and later finds himself waking up in Mr. Krabs' office. Now wearing Mr. Krabs' outfit, Plankton looks at a nameplate reading \"Mr. Plankton\" and realizes that he has successfully entered a universe where he is, in fact, successful. His first act is to have Alternate-Universe SpongeBob SquarePants, now his employee, present him with two Krabby Patties for \"bun inspection.\"\nAs Mr. Plankton drools over the Krabby Patties and celebrates his newfound power and wealth, SpongeBob suddenly pops back in for his weekly performance review. Mr. Plankton tells his yellow underling that he is fine the way he is, but begs for evaluation and criticism. Plankton casually and dismissively remarks that SpongeBob used \"a little too much sauce,\" but rather than placating him, this critique sends SpongeBob spiraling into a bizarrely-manifested despair even though he wanted to be criticized. Mr. Plankton resorts to promoting SpongeBob to \"co-cashier,\" much to the disdain of Mr. Plankton's other new employee, Alternate-Universe Squidward Tentacles. Squidward enters Plankton's office to complain and ends up as SpongeBob's fry-cooking replacement.\nBefore Mr. Plankton can get back to his Krabby Patties, his new daughter, Pearl Plankton, arrives, asking for an advance on her allowance. He gives her a dollar, which she finds unacceptably paltry. As she sobs, a customer, Incidental 41, comes to complain about Squidward's horrific attempt at cooking while SpongeBob dissolves over a slightly mistaken order. Mr. Plankton begs for all the complaining to stop, which does in the face of a siren going off.\nThe siren, as SpongeBob and the others explain, is a warning for an imminent threat to the Krabby Patty formula, a threat that turns out to be Alternate-Universe Eugene Krabs. Having life circumstances closer to those Plankton used to have at the beginning of the episode, he is now simply known as \"Krabs,\" out to steal the formula, and, much like Plankton used to be, completely naked. SpongeBob fights Krabs off with a clothes-shooting cannon and finally manages to clap him in an underwired bra. Krabs relinquishes his stolen patty to a baffled Mr. Plankton as everyone at the Krusty Krab gives a shrill \"victory screech.\"\nKrabs vows to Mr. Plankton that one day he will manage to steal a Krabby Patty repeatedly, even if he has to raid the place daily. Plankton finally finds his nemesis' life intolerable. He then screams and disrobes before hitting a button, and everything goes back to normal.\nPlankton is transported directly in front of his holographic meatloaf back at the Chum Bucket within his home universe. He has a newfound appetite for the meatloaf and scoops it up, \"eating\" eagerly, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "SpongeGuard on Duty", "completion": "One day at Goo Lagoon, SpongeBob and Patrick are sunbathing. SpongeBob notices the adoration that the lifeguard, Larry the Lobster, receives, and fantasizes about how \"cool\" it would be if he was a lifeguard himself, but Patrick has no fondness for lifeguards. After being told to conceal his large gut by another beach-goer, Patrick stomps off to the snack bar. SpongeBob declares that he is already as cool as Larry and that nothing but an airborne ice cream truck striking him down could prove otherwise.\nOne such collision later, Larry helps SpongeBob up and sees that vanilla ice cream has been smeared on his nose. Thinking that it is sunscreen and that therefore he is a lifeguard, Larry enlists the all-too-eager SpongeBob in helping him with his duties. As a lifeguard, SpongeBob becomes very popular and does many fun activities, and is happy to accept taking the second shift solo. However, Larry hears a swimmer drowning and saves him, causing SpongeBob to realize too late that the role of a lifeguard is a serious one that involves rescuing people from mortal danger.\nHis shift now over, Larry heads off for the tanning booth, leaving SpongeBob, who cannot swim, in charge of the beach. SpongeBob tries to laugh off his fears, but cannot help but imagine the sea of swimmers in the lagoon as a sea of tombstones instead. In a panic, he alerts all the fish to an \"emergency\" and orders them out of the lagoon. When asked what is happening, he claims that sharks have infested the lagoon, a comment that does not sit well with a family of sapient sharks in the crowd. He then raves about a sea monster, and is then confronted by an actual sea monster who slaps SpongeBob in the face. The frustrated crowd then disperses and heads back to the lagoon, much to SpongeBob's dismay.\nStressed out from watching the beach-goers engaging in risky activities, SpongeBob resorts to luring everyone out of the lagoon with free ice cream. Once everyone has some to eat, SpongeBob points out that they must now wait one hour to re-enter the lagoon, and binds them with police tape to enforce this rule. Patrick, who has been in the restroom, runs out in search of ice cream when SpongeBob gloats about how his trick makes him superior to Larry. Misreading the police tape as a sign for ice cream, he breaks through it to go into the lagoon, where he gets cramps and starts drowning.\nWhile the crowd tries to alert SpongeBob to this real emergency, he initially refuses to believe them. However, he eventually sees Patrick and springs into action, desperate to find a way to save him without having to swim. He confiscates a boatmobile from a couple in the parking lot, though he returns their hotdog. SpongeBob rows the boat out to the lagoon, but the frantic Patrick tears it apart while flailing his arms. Upon realizing his actions, he and SpongeBob both start drowning, with Patrick actively harming SpongeBob up to stay afloat. As they say their goodbyes, Larry arrives in time to pull them up from the ankle-deep lagoon.\nRealizing that SpongeBob does not know how to swim, Larry sets him and Patrick to work practicing their swimming in a kiddie pool. They both somehow wind up with butt cramps, with Patrick still lamenting his lack of ice cream, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Club SpongeBob", "completion": "The episode begins with Squidward leaving his house and riding his bicycle to work. He then rides past a tall tree, at the top of which is a tree house where SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting and giggling profusely. They see Squidward below and talk to each other about him, beginning certain words with \"w.\" Squidward approaches the base of the tree and asks in perturbation if this manner of speaking is some kind of stupid code, and SpongeBob tells Squidward that he cannot tell him because he is not a member of their club. Squidward mocks them, saying that he is more than qualified to join their club. SpongeBob tells Squidward he could not fit in even if he tried. Squidward tells them that he is \"a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom,\" but SpongeBob and Patrick continue to insist that he would not fit in. Enraged, Squidward tells them they know nothing of \"fitting in\" before he proceeds to climb the tree. SpongeBob and Patrick frantically tell Squidward to stop, but he does not.\nSquidward crawls into their tree house, and SpongeBob and Patrick explain that they meant that he literally could not \"fit in,\" and that they have been stuck up there for three days. SpongeBob and Patrick begin Squidward's initiation into their \"club,\" but Squidward stops them, and attempts to get out by pulling on a smaller tree. He manages to make the tree double over and is about to crawl out when the second tree snaps, launching the tree house (with its three occupants) into the sky. They fly over the Kelp Forest, where a couple sees them, the man believing the tree house to be a shooting star.\nThe trio crash in a small clearing in a distant section of the kelp forest. SpongeBob and Patrick begin to jump and joyfully shout while Squidward panics at his situation of being lost and stuck with SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick try to comfort Squidward by telling him it could be worse, and that they will survive as a club and as long as they have the \"Magic Conch Shell,\" a Magic 8 ball-like device which SpongeBob and Patrick treat as prophetic and all-knowing. They believe the Magic Conch should never be questioned and should always be consulted before any action is taken. SpongeBob asks it what they must do to escape the kelp forest, to which the conch says, \"Nothing.\" SpongeBob and Patrick sit still on the ground doing nothing, and Squidward is enraged at their stupidity. He announces that he intends to escape the forest and get back to sanity by himself instead of taking advice from a stupid toy, and walks away. As Squidward tries to find an exit, he becomes lost and afraid and eventually comes back to where SpongeBob and Patrick are.\nEven more time passes, and by now, Squidward has dismantled the box to build a shelter. He has a hat made out of some dried plant, has grown a five-o'clock shadow, and is sitting by a small campfire. A small bug scurries past, and Squidward catches it and proceeds to cook it. He taunts SpongeBob and Patrick with his \"food,\" saying that they could have sided with him and survived, but instead listened to a talking shell. He proceeds to say while chuckling, \"As if the answers to all your problems will fall right out of the sky!\"\nAbove the forest, a damaged plane is serendipitously falling right out of the sky, and the pilots drop their load of picnic supplies and food to avoid crashing. The equipment lands around SpongeBob and Patrick, who emerge from their state of doing nothing to praise the magic conch. Squidward is extremely shocked, and he walks over to the two, who are devouring a table full of food. Squidward says he was only kidding earlier, and asks if he is still a member of the club, and SpongeBob tells him that he is still a member. Squidward cannot decide what to choose, and begrudgingly follows SpongeBob's suggestion of asking the conch shell. Squidward asks the conch permission to eat certain specific food items, which it denies. He repeatedly asks it permission to eat anything, which it denies every time. Squidward becomes enraged when the conch denies permission in a mocking tone, and is about to go insane when a Park Ranger enters the clearing.\nSquidward tells him he has been stranded with SpongeBob, Patrick, and the magic conch shell for weeks, and his mention of the \"magic conch shell\" prompts the ranger to pull out an identical conch, revealing himself to also be cultishly obedient to the conch, much to Squidward's exasperated dismay. SpongeBob and Patrick are delighted to meet a \"club member,\" and the ranger tells them that his conch advised him to look for them. The three club members praise the magic conch before asking it how to get out of the kelp forest. It again tells them, \"Nothing.\" Following the conch's advice, they do nothing and assume sitting positions on the ground (until someone else comes and rescues them). Squidward, at the end of his sanity, praises the magic conch and sits down as well, as the episode ends."}

At the end of the day, SpongeBob decides to keep Mystery as his new pet, and lets her stay at his house.\nWhen SpongeBob arrives at work the next morning, he leaves Mystery outside at the bike post. Scooter and Wobbles approach Mystery and mistake her for a kiddy ride. Wobbles suggest Scooter try it out, and when he inserts a coin into her \"slot,\" Mystery kicks him into the distance and he blows upon impact. Wobbles run away screaming, causing Mr. Krabs to come out and see what the trouble is. He sees Mystery and mistakes her for a monster; SpongeBob tells him that she is his pet, but due to her injuring a prospective customer, he is ordered to get rid of her, and if he disregards his order, he will be fired for not cooperating with him.\nSpongeBob attempts to hide her in a cupboard in the kitchen while Patrick finishes building a stable. SpongeBob offers Mystery a Krabby Patty, which she begins craving after eating. While he initially avoids being caught sneaking Mystery into the kitchen, SpongeBob gets in trouble when Mr. Krabs comes out of his office a second time and witnesses him curing a sick Mystery, who had developed a stomachache from consuming various objects moments prior. Mr. Krabs is upset with his employee, and he tells SpongeBob that the horse has got to go, but SpongeBob is extremely reluctant to proceed due to great sentiment.\nMr. Krabs, feeling sympathy for SpongeBob, tells him a story of his favorite dollar and how he eventually spent it for a soda on a hot day. He tells SpongeBob that Mystery needs to be freed because the indoors are not a place for a wild animal, and SpongeBob consents and takes Mystery out the front door, where he painfully asks her to leave. Mr. Krabs tries to comfort SpongeBob until Squidward shows him an empty safe. Realizing that Mystery ate the Krusty Krab's finances, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs chase after her, disappearing into the distance.

After seeing the customer eat it, Squidward expresses his disgust for Krabby Patties, despite never having eaten one. SpongeBob insists that he tries one, claiming that they are so popular that the only people who dislike Krabby Patties have never eaten one. To get SpongeBob to leave him alone, Squidward eventually does and bites only a piece of the patty off. Squidward's opinion of Krabby Patties seems to remain unchanged, as he angrily says to SpongeBob that the one he tried was the worst food he has ever eaten and buries the patty to its \"death.\"\nWhen a dejected SpongeBob leaves, Squidward desperately digs up the patty and eats the remains when he realizes that he likes them. He wants to have more, but after already stating that he hates Krabby Patties to SpongeBob, Squidward then forces himself to sneak for one without him knowing, as he thinks that SpongeBob would never let him live it down if he found out that Squidward likes them. Squidward tries to have another Krabby Patty by stating an \"order\" to SpongeBob for a Triple Krabby Supreme on a kelp bun, with extra sea pickles and burnt to the crisp. After making it, SpongeBob announces the supposed customer's order, but no one responds, bringing him to the conclusion that they must have left, so he eats it himself, leaving Squidward disappointed over his missed opportunity.\nAfter this attempt fails, Squidward then resorts to eating a half-eaten Krabby Patty from the trash can and digs it up, but before he can eat it, SpongeBob grabs the patty and sadly burns it, claiming that a Krabby Patty should not be disposed of in such means, once again ruining Squidward's chance to have another Krabby Patty.\nAfter having a dream of a giant Krabby Patty as his wife, a determined Squidward continues to try to eat another patty by going back to the Krusty Krab in the middle of the night. He then enters the patty vault, where legions of ready-made Krabby Patties are. Before he can finally have another, SpongeBob enters. Squidward is surprised that SpongeBob is there until SpongeBob says that he always comes to work at 3 a.m. to count the sesame seeds. SpongeBob is confused why Squidward is in the Krusty Krab at such an early time with the patty vault open and a Krabby Patty behind his back, before realizing that he likes Krabby Patties. Once SpongeBob asks Squidward, the latter openly states that he indeed loves Krabby Patties before wolfing down the patties in the vault. SpongeBob admits he knew it \"all along\" that Squidward could not resist a Krabby Patty's taste. However, soon, Squidward starts eating many Krabby Patties, and SpongeBob warns Squidward not to eat all of them. All of the eaten Krabby Patties go down to Squidward's thighs and, as Squidward sarcastically predicts, cause him to subsequently explode.\nLater, as the episode ends, a bodiless Squidward is taken to the hospital in an ambulance, and a paramedic who is sitting beside him, holding his tentacles, jokingly says that he remembers the time he had his first Krabby Patty."}

An extremely paranoid SpongeBob tries to seek help and to reason with Flats, but to no avail.\nSpongeBob asks Patrick for help, only to learn that he and Flats were buddies back in community college. He then tries to go to Mrs. Puff to help, who talks to Flats and explains to SpongeBob that \"kicking his butt\" means that Flats wants to become his friend, which is obviously not true. He then encounters Flats' dad in a boat and confronts him about his son's actions, only for the latter to go up to his father and threaten him as well, because he said \"Now he's gonna kick my butt!\". SpongeBob panics and sprints away.\nHe eventually runs away into town, where Flats attempts to run him over with a garbage truck, but he eventually drives over a banana peel SpongeBob drops, causing it to flip over. Flats awakens in the hospital, where he learns that SpongeBob saved his life by performing CPR on him for five hours straight.\nDespite this, Flats continues to pursue SpongeBob; when SpongeBob runs through town, some people kick an old man's butt who they think is going to kick SpongeBob's butt. The old man was by a bus stop and Harold asks how many times they have to teach him this lesson. Eventually, he corners SpongeBob in his own home, where he proceeds to beat him up.\nHowever, due to SpongeBob's spongy body, he absorbs the blows without harm. Flats continues to hit SpongeBob nonstop throughout all of next week, until he finally faints from exhaustion; his classmates cheer for SpongeBob. However, pitying Flats, SpongeBob starts a speech about how violence leads to nowhere, which ends with him making a fist. Mrs. Puff enters and sees Flats unconscious and SpongeBob making a fist, and believes SpongeBob beat up Flats. Mrs. Puff ends the episode by shouting to a stunned SpongeBob that she is going to kick his butt."}
{"prompt": "Nasty Patty", "completion": "As the episode starts on a dark and stormy night at Bikini Atoll, the French Narrator is reminded of the time when Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob thought they murdered a health inspector, and decides to tell the story.\nOne bright sunny morning at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is cooking and Mr. Krabs is having a \"money bath\" as the health inspector arrives for a surprise inspection. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to get him one of everything on the menu, which he does. After a few dishes, he orders one ordinary Krabby Patty before he can pass judgment. Meanwhile, a television report reveals that an impostor is passing himself off as a health inspector conning restaurants in order to get free food. Outraged at the prospect of giving away free food, Mr. Krabs believes that the one in their venue is not genuine and schemes to play a nasty prank on him. He and SpongeBob concoct the \"Nasty Patty\" using Volcano Sauce, seahorse radish, and toenail clippings. For good measure, SpongeBob drops it in the toilet and Mr. Krabs dries it with his gym socks.\nHowever, before the health inspector could consume it, a fly goes into his mouth, chokes him, knocks him out, and then flies out of his mouth. As SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs enjoy watching him suffer from the kitchen, thinking he already ate it, another TV report confirms the impostor has been arrested and his picture is shown, revealing him to be a different individual. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs then believe that their patty killed the real health inspector, and they begin to panic, blaming each other. Mr. Krabs ultimately decides to take the body out and bury it so that nobody would discover what they did.\nSpongeBob and Mr. Krabs take the health inspector out to the top of a hill and quickly bury him. In the process of doing so, the health inspector, semi-conscious, gets hit in the head by a large rock SpongeBob dug up. The police then show up, offering to take them back to the Krusty Krab. Then it starts to rain, causing the dirt covering the health inspector (who was buried upright) to turn to mud and the health inspector slides back down the hill. Mr. Krabs has SpongeBob put him in the trunk of the police car with the shovel. On the way back to the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to bring the health inspector to the back door and put him in the freezer, using shovel as code for the body. SpongeBob thinks he is talking about the actual shovel and attempts to ask him what he wants him to do with the inspector, nearly revealing what they did. Mr. Krabs cuts him off and makes it look like he was asking about bottles of soda, which makes the cops suspicious.\nBack at the restaurant, SpongeBob tries to take the body out back and hide it in the freezer. However, the back door is locked, leaving SpongeBob to carry on his most difficult task: he marches through the front door with the body stuffed inside his hat, making him lose his balance as he struggles to walk over to the kitchen door. The officers ask Mr. Krabs about SpongeBob's strange behavior, only for him to attempt to stall them and bribe them with money. The officers are then called through their walkie-talkies and receive a sudden report about two people burying a body on the hill on Shallow Grave Road (obviously Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob with the health inspector).\nAs they are about to leave, one of the cops asks for a soda and Krabs quickly hands it over. But then the cop wants ice as well and Mr. Krabs grows really nervous, prompting the officer to go inside the freezer and get the ice herself. Mr. Krabs freaks out, barricades the door, and makes excuses about not having any ice. The officer simply shoves him aside and she about to get the ice herself, when Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob confess that they have committed a murder and say the body has been hidden in the freezer.\nWhen the police opens the freezer, however, they discover nothing and deem it as a hoax. One of the officers jokingly suggests that the health inspector became a zombie and walked out if he was killed and hidden there in the first place. Soon after, the health inspector shows up and the terrified officers savagely attack him, only stopping after they realize he is not zombified. The health inspector informs Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob that they have passed the test. They all go to have Krabby Patties to celebrate and the inspector is hit by the door. The narrator ends the episode by deeming the characters to be idiots."}
{"prompt": "Idiot Box", "completion": "The episode starts with Squidward coming outside his house to see a TV getting delivered to SpongeBob and Patrick in a box. He is shocked that they ordered such a large TV, only for them to toss the TV into the trash bin and use the box by itself. He asks the two why they are playing in the box instead of using the TV, and they say that with imagination, they can do anything they want to do. Squidward drags the TV to his house with SpongeBob's permission, while the other two play Mountain Climbing Adventure in the box.\nWhen Squidward gets annoyed by the two playing loudly with each other, he kicks the box, only to cause what sounds like an avalanche inside. He opens the box to see if the two are alright, only for them to have just been imagining themselves mountain climbing. Squidward goes back to his house and tries to find a box to do what SpongeBob and Patrick are doing, but is unable to find one big enough. After kicking one of his boxes in frustration, he hears police sirens outside and initially assumes they have come to arrest him for kicking the box, but the sounds turn out to just be coming from SpongeBob and Patrick in their box.\nFeeling angrier still, Squidward kicks his small box across his yard and SpongeBob and Patrick take it. He watches TV to get his mind off of boxes, only for all the programming to be box-related. He then hears what sounds like a space rocket launching coming from the box and thinks the two are using a tape recorder to make all the noises, so he goes inside to find out. When he finds that they do not have a tape recorder, he goes inside the box and starts observing their activities to see how they play. However, within the box, the only sounds are subtle and come from SpongeBob and Patrick themselves, so Squidward goes back to his house in frustration, only to hear much louder and varied sounds.\nAt night, when the two get out of the box and go to bed, Squidward decides to go inside the box to find the button he feels sure is making all the sounds, but he does not find it. When he starts pretending to drive a race car, a garbage truck by coincidence is picking up the box and taking it off to the dump; the garbage truck's sounds make Squidward feel like he is actually driving a boat. It does not end well when the box is tossed on its side, sending Squidward into the air and falling into the dump, landing face first into a partially eaten pie. The next morning, SpongeBob and Patrick find out that their box is gone and then go see Squidward, unaware that he is not home, ending the episode from there."}
{"prompt": "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy IV", "completion": "In the opening, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are entering the Krusty Krab for lunch, but Squidward and Barnacle Boy have an argument. Squidward, unimpressed with the duo's heroic career, casually mocks them, causing SpongeBob to realize they are in the restaurant and go into an excited frenzy, eagerly requesting their autograph. The heroes run away from him, accidentally leaving Mermaid Man's belt inside. SpongeBob finds it and tries to give it back, but they drive away in the invisible boatmobile before he can do so.\nSpongeBob decides to wear the belt and play with it, thinking that he could hold on to it until after work. He discovers the \"Small Ray\" and starts shrinking the items in the kitchen. At the register, Squidward is suddenly startled by the commotion in the kitchen, which causes him to mess up a customer's order by accident, resulting in a punch in the face. This prompts Squidward to enter the kitchen and ask SpongeBob where the ruckus is coming from, only to see almost everything shrunken. Squidward at that moment discovers that SpongeBob has acquired Mermaid Man's belt. Assuming that SpongeBob has stolen the belt, Squidward plans to do the right thing and call Mermaid Man in order to inform him of the situation. Worried that his reputation with the heroes will deteriorate, SpongeBob panics and shrinks Squidward with the belt after SpongeBob fearfully tells Squidward that if Mermaid Man finds out, he will be kicked out of his fan club for good. Squidward demands SpongeBob to return him to normal size, but he has no idea how. Due to the belt's complicated and excessive features, he instead accidentally puts Squidward through increasingly ridiculous and excruciating torments. Squidward suggests getting Mermaid Man's help, but SpongeBob still refuses, stating someone else must be able to help him and not wanting Mermaid Man to find out.\nSpongeBob goes to Patrick for help, to no avail. Patrick mistakes Squidward for an action figure and starts playing with him, even after being told that he is the real Squidward. Patrick then suggests turning the \"M\" upside down, setting the belt to W for \"Wumbo,\" a meaningless term seemingly coined by Patrick. SpongeBob questions the existence of this word, but Patrick responds by conjugating \"Wumbo\" and combining it with a handful of other suffixes. SpongeBob is finally convinced by this idea and decides to test it out, but then he accidentally shrinks Patrick. Squidward orders SpongeBob to take him and Patrick to Mermaid Man for help, but SpongeBob still refuses as he does not want Mermaid Man to find out, and places him and Patrick in a jar. Seconds later, citizens start coming to and greeting SpongeBob, prompting him to shrink them so that they cannot tell Mermaid Man that he has gained possession of the belt.\nEventually, SpongeBob has shrunken everyone in Bikini Bottom and crams them all into the jar. When his mother tells him he needs to admit his mistakes, he then realizes he shrunk Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy as well, and he tearfully apologizes to them. Mermaid Man accepts his apology and trudges through his senility to remember a story about the first time he used the belt, until everyone interrupts him and demands that he tell SpongeBob how to return them to normal size. After thinking for a moment, Mermaid Man asks SpongeBob if he set the belt to \"Wumbo,\" which makes everyone realize that Mermaid Man does not remember how to restore them to normal size either.\nThe citizens then form a mob and venture into SpongeBob's body, then begin assaulting his internal organs and bones. This goes on a for a while until everyone says aloud that SpongeBob is too big to be destructible, which gives him the idea to shrink Bikini Bottom before shrinking himself.\nThe citizens are pleased with this, as they see no discernable difference from their previous lives to living in a miniature Bikini Bottom. As the citizens celebrate, a bus pulls up and Plankton steps out, returning to Bikini Bottom from a vacation. He is surprised that the city is now smaller than him as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Doing Time", "completion": "The episode opens as SpongeBob is taking his driver's license exam yet again. He ends up leaving the driving course and wrecking the boating school and the city, before driving off an unfinished bridge the mayor just opened and falling into an abyss. The police follow the boat and end up driving off the bridge and into the abyss themselves. SpongeBob, Mrs. Puff, and the police all land on top of a truck full of fruit punch being delivered to Shady Shoals Rest Home, causing it to fall over and spill all the punch. The rest home gets flooded with it as a result. Although SpongeBob is responsible, the incident occurred under Mrs. Puff's supervision, and she is sent to prison for gross negligence. In prison, she realizes that she will not see SpongeBob again for a very long time, and starts to enjoy it.\nMeanwhile, SpongeBob is depressed that Mrs. Puff is in jail and Patrick tells him that it is SpongeBob's fault. The duo sets out to free her from jail. First, they try to rob the \"1st Nautical Bank\" in order to get arrested themselves, but SpongeBob gets wrapped up in the bureaucratic niceties of banking and forgets they are trying to commit a crime. Next, they disguise themselves as rocks that the prisoners smash as labor. They try to communicate with Mrs. Puff, who calls the guards, but they dismiss her conversation with two rocks as a hallucination and move her to kitchen duty. SpongeBob and Patrick are then smashed by another inmate, costing them their deposit on the costumes. Then they hide in a vat of chili in the cafeteria and offer to help Mrs. Puff escape through it, but she explains to them that she likes it in prison, which SpongeBob refuses to believe. He worries that Mrs. Puff is completely institutionalized in prison and he needs to get her out. In an attempt to coax her, SpongeBob tells Mrs. Puff if she can escape, he will stay after school and decorate the entire classroom, but Mrs. Puff refuses. She calls for the prison guards again and is reassigned again after the prison guards believe that Mrs. Puff is going crazy.\nSpongeBob and Patrick appear to her yet again on a coat hanger assembly line, and when she calls for a guard, he somehow perceives SpongeBob and Patrick as raw materials, stamps them, and sends Mrs. Puff to her cell, still convinced that she is going insane. SpongeBob and Patrick next appear in Mrs. Puff's toilet, which causes the guards to flush them. Then they appear on her bed, and when Mrs. Puff calls the guards, they turn out to be SpongeBob and Patrick in disguise. When she next sees the real guards as they ask Mrs. Puff what is going on, she rips off their faces thinking they are SpongeBob and Patrick still in disguise. She is finally put in solitary confinement after the guards believe that Mrs. Puff has completely lost her sanity. She is glad that she is finally safe from SpongeBob, but she actually begins hallucinating her completely yellow padded cell to be made of sponge, and is tormented by his laughter.\nMrs. Puff wakes up screaming in the car flying off the cliff and realizes that the juice truck incident and her prison sentence were products of her imagination. The car crashes into the juice truck again; however, this time, SpongeBob is arrested instead of Mrs. Puff, because he now fails the driving test. She is happy that she is not going to the jail, but a police officer tells her that she already did her time, and Mrs. Puff sees herself wearing a prison outfit with a chain ball in her ankle. She wakes up screaming in the car flying off the cliff again. When she is about to relax, she sees Donna, a prisoner with a masculine voice from her first hallucination who asked her what the prison's cafeteria was serving, driving the boat instead of SpongeBob. She wakes up screaming in the car flying off the cliff, yet again. This time, it becomes reality that there's SpongeBob driving the boat and there are no police cars chasing them. She panics for a moment, but after realizing she is just going to loop again, she stops screaming, says \"Oh, forget it,\" and unenthusiastically sits in the boat, ending the episode from there."}
{"prompt": "Snowball Effect", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, an iceberg travels across the surface of the ocean and stops over Bikini Atoll, causing it to snow underwater in Bikini Bottom. The Realistic Fish Head reports on the scene to inform the Bikini Bottomite masses on the heavy snowfall across the city. Everyone notices and starts to have fun in the snow, while SpongeBob and Patrick decide to have a snowball fight. Meanwhile, Squidward is relaxing at his house, sitting near a fire and drinking a hot cup of tea. He hears the sounds of SpongeBob and Patrick building snow forts and tells them to quiet down. The duo try to convince him to come out and play with them, both trying to get him on their own side, but Squidward turns down both their offers, dismissing snowball fights as childish.\nSquidward decides that, as entertainment, he will watch them fight, hoping they will get hurt. However, SpongeBob and Patrick took Squidward's words to heart and signed a peace treaty. Squidward tries to convince them to continue for his entertainment, but repeatedly gets hit with a snowball by Patrick as a result. He then decides to throw a snowball at SpongeBob and Patrick, but misses both of them. SpongeBob and Patrick interpret the launching of snowballs as a declaration of \"war,\" then proceed to duck behind their fort and mercilessly begin to pelt Squidward with snowballs. Afterwards, a frustrated Squidward proceeds to throw a snowball and hits SpongeBob right in the face. He quickly begins to enjoy himself and soon becomes exhilarated. He starts to relentlessly pelt SpongeBob and Patrick with more snowballs. After Patrick is hit by a snowball containing Squidward's clarinet, he and SpongeBob decide that Squidward is taking the snowball fight far too seriously and sneak off.\nWhen Squidward notices that the snowballs have \"stopped falling,\" he takes the opportunity to assess his defenses. Realizing his fort is too small, Squidward decides to make it bigger and eventually builds it to the size of a tower, later to be known as \"Fort Squidward.\" When an overhead tree branch begins to drop snow on his head, Squidward believes snowballs are being thrown at him by SpongeBob and Patrick and repeatedly hurls out snowballs in random directions.\nMeanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick relax in the pineapple, watching TV while drinking hot chocolate and eating popcorn. SpongeBob faintly hears Squidward's yelling for a moment and asks Patrick if he also heard something. The episode ends after Patrick replies, \"Nope.\""}

SpongeBob and Patrick come by, and Mr. Krabs tricks them into buying a soda drinking hat and a plunger respectively. When they leave, some business people come by and to discuss purchasing the soda drinking hat with Mr. Krabs, unaware that it has already been sold. After each of them offers a large sum of money to him for the hat, Mr. Krabs runs to SpongeBob to get the hat back.\nMr. Krabs finds SpongeBob, who has modified the hat to blow bubbles. He first tells SpongeBob that he looks like a girl with the hat, but SpongeBob thinks it was a compliment. Mr. Krabs then tries to offer him other hats in exchange for the soda drinking hat, but SpongeBob declines the offers. At night, Mr. Krabs draws a ghost on a paper and uses a fishing rod to scare SpongeBob into giving up the hat. The \"ghost\" tells SpongeBob that he must give the hat back to the owner; when pressed, Mr. Krabs invents the name Smitty Werbenjägermanjensen. However, Krabs' plan backfires when it turns out there to be an actual dead person with that name and SpongeBob has placed the hat with Jensen's remains. Mr. Krabs goes to the cemetery to retrieve it. He goes looking for the grave, seeing Squidward weeping over a grave literally memorializing his hopes and dreams along the way, until finally finding Smitty's massive tombstone.\nHe defiles the grave and takes the hat out, only for Smitty to rise up and tell him to give the hat back. When Mr. Krabs refuses, he gets the army of the living dead to attack him. Fortunately, he successfully defeats all the skeletons and runs back to the business people to get his money. However, they have found out there is a whole warehouse of those hats, severely depreciating their value. They see SpongeBob wearing a hat with clapping hands and chase after him to buy the hat from him for even higher sums than they offered Mr. Krabs for his hat. Mr. Krabs breaks down at the lost financial opportunity. Squidward passes by, watching Mr. Krabs cry and ironically calls his boss a baby as the episode ends."}

Despite the horrendous production values and quality of the commercial, and SpongeBob's background role in it, he proclaims it to be the best 60 seconds of his life.\nThe next morning, while SpongeBob is walking to work, Old Man Walker sees him and tells him that he saw him on TV the previous night, albeit not in the same commercial. SpongeBob does not know this, making him think that he is famous. At work, he treats people as if they were his fans and fails to perform his job properly.\nEventually, he quits his job to become an entertainer and is confronted by the crowd of hungry customers, who he thinks want him to entertain them. He begins to juggle patties and accidentally slips on grease, sending the patties flying. Just as he thinks that his \"career\" is over, the patties drop on the grill, which pleases the customers.\nSpongeBob notices this and continues to make Krabby Patties like normal, still believing he is entertaining his customers and is very famous.

To his horror, he discovers that the first dime he earned has gone missing, and Squidward is accused of stealing it, as he mans the register all day. Squidward angrily denies this and squeezes Mr. Krabs' eyes, and after a heated argument ensues between the two, Squidward quits his job. SpongeBob runs outside and attempts to convince Squidward to change his mind. But after hearing Squidward's great ambitions, SpongeBob leaves him be and insists that if Squidward needs anything, he can seek help from him.\nAfter some time, SpongeBob encounters Squidward again. Unable to find a new job, Squidward has become homeless and is now living on the streets in a cardboard box begging passersby for spare change. After his cardboard box repossession, Squidward laments his failure and sobs. Feeling bad for Squidward, SpongeBob lets him stay at his house until he can find a new job, pampering him with breakfast in bed and massages. One night, while SpongeBob attempts to get some sleep, Squidward repeatedly calls him for various minute reasons, which end with SpongeBob falling down the stairs. Gary tries to tell SpongeBob that Squidward is being a freeloader and taking advantage of him, but SpongeBob is in denial, giving several excuses as to why Squidward has not yet gotten a job.\nHowever, many months pass by and it becomes obvious that Squidward has no intention of finding new employment, instead becoming completely dependent on SpongeBob and turning him into a manservant of sorts. At this point, SpongeBob begins to lose his patience, so he tries conveying several less-than-subtle hints to Squidward in order to push him to look for work, such as serving Squidward a bowl of alphabet soup with the letters arranged to read \"Get a job.\" and trying to get him to write a newsprint that says \"Job Listings.\" (which he blatantly lies to be \"allergic\" to it.)\nThese hints prove to be useless, as Squidward deliberately ignores them, so SpongeBob tries to make it as simple as he can by actually talking him down and not even using hints, but still to no avail. Eventually, a fed up SpongeBob pushes the bed that Squidward is lying on through the upstairs wall and all the way to the Krusty Krab. While Mr. Krabs talks on the phone with charity, SpongeBob throws the phone, gives him a dime, and angrily demands that he give Squidward his job back. Mr. Krabs says that the dime is not his first dime, refuses, and rudely throws it on his face, even turning down the many other dimes that SpongeBob offers by throwing at his face. Finally at the end of his threat, SpongeBob snaps, grabs Mr. Krabs by the throat and lashes out at him for his cheapness and the ridiculousness of the situation because of a dime and violently shaking him while doing so. Suddenly, the first dime falls out of his pants, a large coin-shaped rock; Mr. Krabs explains that he has been in the business \"for a long time,\" revealing that it was in his pocket the whole time.\nSquidward is rehired to his original position, and all seems well until Mr. Krabs accuses Squidward of placing the dime in his pocket. This starts a new dispute, and while the two continue to argue, SpongeBob changes into his maid outfit, which anticipates the inevitable."}

He turns around to see who threw the \"paper\" at him, and SpongeBob gets scared because the man is intimidating and tough. SpongeBob covers it up by hiding until Sandy comes and he comes out. Sandy comes and asks what they are standing in line for and the man says they are waiting in line for The Salty Spitoon, the toughest sailor club in Bikini Bottom, which only the toughest fish can get in.\nThe bouncer, Reg, allows Sandy in, as she is one of the toughest fighters in Bikini Bottom, but rejects SpongeBob because he is too weak. Reg suggests that SpongeBob should instead go to Weenie Hut Jr. and then Super Weenie Hut Jr's, much to SpongeBob's annoyance and humiliation. SpongeBob tries other methods, like telling him a story about how he painfully stubbed his toe while watering his spice garden and only crying for 20 minutes, wearing a wig to disguise himself, and posing as a tattoo on a man's arm. A sponge called \"Drifter\" is also shown and mistaken for SpongeBob, but the real SpongeBob shows up with a clown wig and Reg lets the Drifter in.\nFinally, SpongeBob goes to Weenie Hut Jr's. The patrons talk about special days at the restaurant and the animatronic server meanly calls SpongeBob a weenie, annoying him in the process. The patrons then suggest ways for SpongeBob to prove his toughness and gain entrance to The Salty Spitoon. SpongeBob figures that the quickest way to do so would be to win a fight, but since he is not very strong, he decides to stage a fight with Patrick.\nThe fight with Patrick is supposed to be the latter letting him win. They sling insults at each other to make the fight seem more realistic, but SpongeBob meanly calls Patrick \"Tubby,\" angering him and leading him to angrily attacking SpongeBob. The latter reminds him that he is supposed to let him win and Patrick proceeds to beat himself up as if there were an invisible person attacking him, even flinging himself into the background.\nReg becomes amazed about SpongeBob beating up Patrick without even touching him and finally allows him to enter The Salty Spitoon.

Squilliam asks Squidward what he has \"accomplished\" since high school. Squidward, panicking, tells him that he owns a five-star restaurant. Squilliam tells Squidward that he and his friends will come to his restaurant tonight, and Squidward is very shocked. He begs Mr. Krabs to let him have control of the Krusty Krab for the day, and when he explains that Squilliam is coming, Mr. Krabs accepts, because he knows that Squilliam has money and wants to stick up for his employee.\nSquidward attempts to train the Krusty Krab crew to turn the establishment into a fancy restaurant. Thinking that he is joining the corps, Patrick appears in the restaurant awaiting orders, and is given the job of collecting the hats. SpongeBob, who does not know how a waiter works yet, is the waiter, and Mr. Krabs, who says he once served on the S.S. Gourmet, is the chef. However, things do not go well; Patrick is beating up the hat rack because it will not \"give\" him its hat, and Mr. Krabs makes terrible food such as peas in stove and an appetizer that has fly wings and more filthy things and says that he worked as a janitor on the S.S. Gourmet and was the head chef on the S.S. Diarrhea, and SpongeBob cannot handle the copy of \"How To Become A Fancy Waiter in Less Than 20 Minutes\" that Squidward gave him. Squidward tells SpongeBob to clear his mind of \"everything that doesn't have to do with fine dining and breathing.\" SpongeBob's mind (which is metaphorically portrayed as an office) is operated by smaller SpongeBobs. Their boss' assistant tells them that he just got an order: Dump everything that is not about fine dining. They begin to get rid of all documents, which represent SpongeBob's knowledge, until SpongeBob just stares into empty space in a catatonic state.\nSquidward runs outside and bumps into Squilliam, who is just about to enter. They both go inside, and see that the Krusty Krab has been transformed into a very fancy five-star restaurant. After sending all the customers to their tables, SpongeBob tells Squidward that he did all of this, and that he has tied up Patrick and Mr. Krabs in the kitchen as punishment. After his meal, Squilliam admits that he is impressed and asks SpongeBob what his name is. However, SpongeBob cannot remember his own name, having discarded it along with everything else, and inside his mind, all of the little SpongeBobs try to find his name, but to no avail, ultimately resulting in his brain damage and snapping in half. SpongeBob goes insane, mindlessly spilling food on patrons and grating the posteriors of others. Still tied up, Mr. Krabs and Patrick run out of the kitchen being chased down by the appetizer the former made earlier which has turned into a living monster. With this, the fancy façade is destroyed, making the Krusty Krab's true nature unveiled.\nSquilliam finds out that Squidward actually is a cashier, humiliating him. However, Squilliam then \"confesses\" that he is also a cashier too and that he lied about being rich to upstage Squidward and beat him. Squidward asks if this is true, but Squilliam reveals that he was just kidding and he really is, \"filthy stinkin' rich!\" He and his crowd leave the restaurant to ride in his \"balloon/casino,\" leaving Squidward dejected and defeated once again, but not before Mr. Krabs comes in and plays him a sad song in the World's Smallest Violin, which annoys him, making him request in anger to leave, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Krab Borg", "completion": "One night, SpongeBob and Gary watch a scary movie called Night of the Robot, which is about robots that take over the world, and it shows a live-action robot chasing a live-action human. Gary tells SpongeBob that he should not watch it, as scary movies freak him out, but SpongeBob denies this. He is then shown laying in bed shaking in fear, wondering if everyone he knows is a robot. After asking Gary if he is a robot, SpongeBob decides he has nothing to worry about and tries to get some sleep. Unfortunately, he has a nightmare about the same robot from the movie chasing him, and the next day at the Krusty Krab, he has become very paranoid and believes that robots are \"everywhere\" (one turning out to be a trolley with cleaning equipment and a sack of Sea Potatoes, and another a red light which was actually the warning light for the deep fryer).\nMeanwhile, Mr. Krabs is in his office, listening to Bikini Bottom's number one hit song on his portable radio, titled \"Electric Zoo.\" Mr. Krabs likes the song and hums to it. SpongeBob later walks past Mr. Krabs' office and overhears him saying he feels \"completely recharged.\" He then witnesses Mr. Krabs talking to his radio, talking in a \"robot\" language over the phone, and doing a bizarre robot-like dance to the song.\nThis convinces SpongeBob to believe that Mr. Krabs is a robot imposter, and he relays this information to Squidward. Squidward does not believe him, so SpongeBob tries several tests to prove that Mr. Krabs is a robot. First, he tests Mr. Krabs' sense of humor by having Squidward tell a joke, but Mr. Krabs does not laugh. SpongeBob says that this is because he is a robot, as robots do not laugh, but Squidward says that \"he's obviously heard it before.\"\nSpongeBob then tests Mr. Krabs' emotions by telling him that Squidward's father never hugged him to see if he will cry. Mr. Krabs says that although it is a little sad, Squidward can hug himself during his break. This further worries SpongeBob, but Squidward says that this is ridiculous and that his father loved him very much. This reminds SpongeBob of the third and final test: the love test. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that Squidward loves him, but he simply tells him to get back to work. Back in his office, Mr. Krabs' radio breaks and he decides to give the batteries to Pearl for her Christmas present. A timer rings, and he grabs a pair of tongs and removes his hard-boiled egg from a pot of boiling water, ready to eat it. But just when Mr. Krabs is about to put some salt on the egg, he is startled when SpongeBob calls out his name the fourth time, and he accidentally tosses the full salt shaker into his eyes, and he screams in pain.\nSquidward then asks SpongeBob what the robots in the movie looked like. SpongeBob says that they had red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and ran on batteries. Squidward then asks if Mr. Krabs looks anything like that, and this is (seemingly) answered when Mr. Krabs barges out of his office screaming in pain with glowing bloodshot eyes, the tongs he used to hold the egg, and the radio batteries in his pocket. As Mr. Krabs runs to the bathroom, Squidward finally believes SpongeBob, and tells him to call the Navy, but due to their automated phone service, SpongeBob thinks that the robots have taken over the Navy. Squidward then announces over the microphone that robots are taking over the world, causing all the customers to flee the Krusty Krab.\nMr. Krabs then emerges from the bathroom, relieved that his eyes are not hurting anymore, and goes back to his office, not noticing that the Krusty Krab is now empty. Squidward then wonders how they will find out what happened to the \"real\" Mr. Krabs, and SpongeBob says that the main character in the movie teamed up with a buddy and they got the poop on, or collected information from, the robot. After reading a book on how to torture, the two go into Mr. Krabs' office and tie him up, demanding to know where the \"real\" Mr. Krabs is. After getting no answers and Mr. Krabs insisting that he is the real Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob and Squidward decide to interrogate his machines, which include a blender, a toaster, a food processor, and a coffee maker.\nThese, of course, do not give any answers either, so Squidward destroys them with a baseball bat. This greatly upsets Mr. Krabs, as he paid good money for them, and he finally breaks down crying when SpongeBob brings in his cash register. He also mentions laughing with it and loving it, revealing that he is not a robot. Squidward then asks SpongeBob how the movie ended. SpongeBob, while thinking the ending was great, remembers that the ending revealed the robot invasion was just in the characters' imagination and that there were no robots after all.\nRealizing his mistake, SpongeBob declares that it is time to feed Gary and runs off, leaving Squidward to take the heat from Mr. Krabs. As a nervous Squidward grabs a broom and begins sweeping, a furious Mr. Krabs growls and screams \"Squidward!\" which ends the episode there."}

They then realize that it was a baby scallop in the middle of the plant making the noise, who is all alone and helpless with no parental guardian, and has yet to develop the ability to fly. SpongeBob and Patrick take it in the former's house and name it \"Junior,\" and raise it as a baby child of their own, with SpongeBob being the mother and Patrick being the father.\nAfterwards, a montage of SpongeBob and Patrick going out dressed as parents, taking Junior on various adventures, is shown. They then return home at night and put Junior to sleep in a cradle in SpongeBob's bedroom, soon going to sleep themselves.\nThe next morning, Patrick eats breakfast and then explains that he has to go to work since he is the father, thus leaving SpongeBob to do all the housework. He promises to give SpongeBob a break when he gets home. Eventually, he returns home only to be exhausted from work, and then tiredly decides to sit on the chair and watch TV for the rest of the night. This goes on for several days until SpongeBob cannot take it anymore.\nSpongeBob angrily lashes out at Patrick. He then furiously shows him all the diapers that Junior used. Patrick, feeling remorse, then realizes the error of his ways and promises to come home at 6:00 PM and give SpongeBob the whole night off.\nHowever, Patrick returns at 12:00 AM from a party at work. SpongeBob is not happy and angrily confronts him on his broken promise as the latter gets annoyed with his constant nagging. SpongeBob angrily follows Patrick, who angrily said that he was going back to work, only to find out that \"work\" consists of Patrick watching television under his rock all day. The duo then gets into an endless argument until they see Junior jumping out a two-story window. They immediately try to catch him, but fail and begin crying for him, believing him to be dead and proclaiming themselves \"bad parents.\" However, they then realize that Junior is alive and well, and has learned to fly. After Junior kisses SpongeBob and flies away, Patrick demands a kiss from Junior, who drops a coconut on the former's head to get back at him for his laziness, but still gives him a kiss. After the parents say goodbye to their son, they are proud to have looked after him. Patrick suggests having another baby, and SpongeBob makes a shocked face (knowing that he will probably do the same thing when they were taking care of him) while the episode ends there."}
{"prompt": "Wet Painters", "completion": "As the episode begins, SpongeBob and Patrick are tearing the Krusty Krab down and getting themselves hurt because Squidward tricked them into thinking it would attract customers. Mr. Krabs figures this out, and sentences the two to do a \"super, special, secret assignment\" - to paint the inside of his house. But Mr. Krabs tells them that the paint they are using is permanent. So if they get even the smallest drop on anything but the wall, he will cut off their rear ends and place them above his fireplace. As they go inside the house, SpongeBob sees that Mr. Krabs has so many possessions, and tells Patrick he decides to move them first. Patrick says that there is no need to move the things because they are not paid to move them.\nThen they place a tarp, but it is just a small tarp, so they put down more tarps. SpongeBob takes out a huge brush but decides to use a tiny brush. SpongeBob takes it out, and then, six hours later, carefully paints a drop onto the wall, which begins dropping. SpongeBob, in a panic that it may get onto an item, blows on it to change direction, and blow dries it off the wall, only to have created a giant paint bubble. Patrick blows another giant bubble shortly after, and the two merge. SpongeBob assures that the bubble cannot get any bigger, but Patrick proves it can by inflating the bubble, causing it to pop, covering Mr. Krabs' whole house in paint, without getting a drop on anything... except on Mr. Krabs' first dollar.\nSpongeBob tries wiping the stain off with his tie, but only ends up covering the entire dollar in paint. SpongeBob ends up fearing about what they did to his dollar, meaning that Mr. Krabs will cut their butts off & mount them on the wall just like what he said before they started painting his house. Then they try a couple more things to get it off, including washing it in a washing machine, spraying it, using a saw, beating it up with a club, and smashing it with a computer, but all fail. Then they decide to put another dollar on the wall. Patrick takes out a dollar from his wallet, but Patrick uses it to buy a chocolate bar from Mr. Krabs' candy machine instead.\nAt that moment, Mr. Krabs comes home, to find his house's lights turned off. He turns them on and sees that his house is tidy, and bubbles are not seen. SpongeBob and Patrick are about to leave, but Mr. Krabs panics, and they think Mr. Krabs finds out about the stained dollar. They apologize, but Mr. Krabs is just surprised that they dusted his knickknacks. He panics again, so SpongeBob and Patrick apologize again, but he is surprised about the painted floor molding. He panics again because he finds out that they messed up his dollar...rama. One of his dolls in the doll collection is not upright. He says that they are free to go now, but then bumps into a pile of paintings jutting from the wall where his dollar usually went and throws away each one to find SpongeBob covering the dollar.\nMr. Krabs soon takes SpongeBob out of the way to find his first dollar stained by paint and drawn on by crayon (Patrick thinks Mr. Krabs will buy it). It seems that Mr. Krabs is going to follow through with his threat and chop SpongeBob and Patrick's butts off. But then, Mr. Krabs licks the dollar, and the paint (including the crayon marking) comes off. The two are confused, and Mr. Krabs reveals the paint really comes off with saliva. SpongeBob concludes that Mr. Krabs lied about the paint being permanent so they would be extra careful, but Mr. Krabs said he tricked them just for fun, and laughs at his jest, causing SpongeBob and Patrick to storm out in disgust. Unfortunately, Mr. Krabs laughs so hard that he spits all over the place, causing all the paint to melt from the walls. He groans in disappointment as he realizes this, and mutters to himself that he needs to learn how to \"say it, not spray it.\""}
{"prompt": "Krusty Krab Training Video", "completion": "For every new Krusty Krab employee, the ultimate career goal is to create a mouth-watering Krabby Patty by hand. However, before one can even think of picking up a spatula, one must thoroughly learn the ropes of the restaurant game, and the Krusty Krab Training Video is the perfect tool for fine-tuning the fresh new cog enthusiastically entering the service industry machine.\n1: From Humble Beginnings\nEugene H. Krabs, from his childhood to his post-war years, has always had an eye for finance. His apt business sense leads to him converting a bankrupt retirement home into the restaurant one may know as the Krusty Krab.\n2: The Krusty Krab Today\nWith the number of technological breakthroughs involved with today's restaurant, a new worker not yet in the know can quickly become overwhelmed. Thankfully, SpongeBob is ready and willing to guide the way to being a good employee, while the less thoroughly prepared employee, tentatively called \"Squidward,\" shall at least provide a clear example of what not to be.\n3: Training\nFor a new employee woefully ignorant of what the customer has come to expect from their Krusty Krab dining experience, learning the meaning of P.O.O.P. (People Order Our Patties) will make things quite clear and concise.\n4: Personal Hygiene\nThe requirements for both cleanliness and personal appearance that an employee is obligated to adhere to are stringent. With diligence and enough soap, however, any employee can learn how to enter each new shift as clean as a whistle.\n5: Your Work Station\nKeeping the cooking and service areas clear of detritus is also very important, and while SpongeBob illustrates how to maintain the order of his tools and ingredients, Squidward demonstrates the trouble a poorly-kept station leads to.\n6: Interfacing With Your Boss\nOne should never fear to ask the proprietor for a raise because the answer will always be the same. This section also covers interacting with the equally-important \"Krustomers\" for optimally profitable results.\n7: Emergency Situation\nIn the event of attempted theft, especially by one Sheldon J. Plankton, this section clearly details the proper protocol for protecting a Krabby Patty in peril. The narrator also reminds Squidward to remember P.O.O.P.\nOnce these lessons have been grilled to perfection into the new employee's brain, he or she shall be ready to reverently receive the secret and sacred method of preparing a Krabby Patty for consumption."}

The scene cuts to SpongeBob trying to read Patchy's invitation, but he cannot understand it because the lettering has been smeared by the water. SpongeBob comments that the sender must not have understood the limitations of life underwater, then throws the invitation in the fire. Back on land, Patchy introduces us to his special guests, including a live-action King Neptune, Minnie Mermaid, and Long-Beard the Pirate.\nIn Bikini Bottom, while shopping at the Barg'N-Mart, SpongeBob finds a \"Plan Your Own Party Kit,\" and decides to throw a party using the kit. Despite the kit advising to invite \"only your closest friends,\" SpongeBob invites nearly everyone in Bikini Bottom. Because a rule in the party kit states that unsupervised parties can lead to disaster, SpongeBob wants the party to go exactly according to plan, so he decides to make sure things go in order. He makes a brutally specific schedule for different activities and cards for people to use for conversations.\nIn the second live-action segment, Patchy decides to have a dance lesson and promotes his dance instruction videos in which Potty finds tacky before Patchy angrily yells at him saying that it is a $40 value. Before Patchy can teach his friends how to dance, a band that Potty has hired for the party arrives. Patchy asks Potty who it is. It is Potty's favorite band, \"The Bird Brains.\" Everybody loves the Bird Brains' music, but Patchy hates it because it is too loud and it blasts him out of his house. Patchy then tells them it is time for them to literally walk the plank. Unfortunately, he forgets that they are birds and can easily fly off.\nBack in Bikini Bottom, later that night, all the guests arrive at different times. SpongeBob is angered when the guests begin doing certain activities which don't occur until much later according to his schedule, and hands them all the topic cards, which causes an awkward environment. After the last guest arrives, SpongeBob goes into the closet.\nAfter a while, SpongeBob sees everybody having fun and starts to panic, as they are violating his completely unnecessary schedule, meaning in his words, the party will fail. He stops all the fun and music, and brings them all to the couch to do one of the scheduled events; reading aloud from the funnies. Unfortunately, he finds out the paper he is reading is yesterday's paper and leaves to get today's paper. Once he leaves, all the guests start having fun again.\nWhile going out to get today's paper, SpongeBob accidentally locks himself out of his house (though it is likely the guests locked him out for ruining their fun), allowing the guests to have fun again. He misinterprets this and believes everything is falling apart.\nAfter continually trying to get into his house using different methods and failing quite horribly, SpongeBob, at wit's end, grabs a pickaxe and attempts to break in while dressed as a bunny. But before he could do so, the police find him and place him under arrest, but when SpongeBob explains everything, they do not arrest him and SpongeBob is relieved he was almost ironically arrested for trying to break into his own house. However, the police end up making him miss the entire party by arresting him on purpose for not inviting them.\nHe returns home the next morning depressed. He notices there was a key underneath the doormat the entire time. SpongeBob then enters his house, finding that it is a complete mess. He believes his party failed, until Patrick comes over and tells him that it was the greatest party all of them had ever been to, and that he should do exactly the same thing next weekend. SpongeBob finally realizes that he does not need a schedule to run a party and parties are supposed to be fun. He smiles gladly and becomes proud that his party was a success after all. He finds Gary wearing a lampshade and is happy that he had fun too. The episode ends as SpongeBob turns off Gary's lamp and wishes his snail a good night's sleep.\nIn the final live-action segment, Patchy attempts to remedy the music situation by performing his own song with a one-man-band he asks Potty if he is ready and Potty says he is after he puts earbuds in his ears and starts performing his own off-key song to the guests. Potty reminds him that it is time for Patchy's flute solo. Patchy starts playing, but soon realizes that he plays a fife, not a flute, and that the \"flute\" is actually a stick of dynamite (it was notably Potty's plan so he would let Patchy perform but find a way to kill him). It explodes, leaving only his head intact. The Bird Brains then have the opportunity to play music, singing their new song, \"Underwater Sun.\" After they finish, Patchy returns to end the special, with a barrel for a new body being kissed by girl parrots. Potty then says \"goodbye\" to the audience and takes on as the host of the party, ending the special."}
{"prompt": "Chocolate with Nuts", "completion": "One day, SpongeBob finds a magazine called Fancy Living Digest in his mail, which depicts the fancy lifestyles of the extremely wealthy. Squidward shows up and takes the magazine, which was actually meant for him, and SpongeBob and Patrick ask him how the people in that magazine can get so rich. Squidward simply answers that they are entrepreneurs and sell items and then leaves, ordering SpongeBob to stay away from his mail. SpongeBob and Patrick, wanting to also become entrepreneurs, decide to sell chocolate bars to raise money in hopes of achieving the fancy lifestyle.\nHowever, no one initially wants to buy any chocolate bars. The first person they visit, Incidental 6, goes berserk upon hearing the word \"chocolate,\" and begins chasing them while madly screaming \"CHOCOLATE!\" He stalks them throughout the episode, appearing and causing them to run away from him at several points. At the next house they visit, SpongeBob and Patrick are convinced to purchase candy bar carrying bags by a con artist. He later scams them again, selling them \"candy bar bag carrying bags.\" The next person is Incidental 49, but SpongeBob has trouble finding her a candy bar amidst all of his bags and she impatiently slams the door in their faces.\nAfter running away from Tom again, they sit in the diner and think about a new approach. Patrick suggests \"Let's get naked,\" but SpongeBob says they should save that strategy for when they are going to sell real estate. They remember how the con artist convinced them to buy the candy bar bags by \"complimenting\" them, not realizing what the man meant when he said they were mediocre salesmen, and decide to try being nicer to the customers. Patrick says \"I love you\" to the first customer they try this on, but he slams the door immediately. They try again, but the customer refuses to buy chocolate since it resulted in him suffering from childhood obesity. He shows them a picture as proof, which Patrick buys. SpongeBob figures that they are too easily distracted and need to stay focused on selling. Patrick takes this too literally and freaks out their next customer by focusing on him with his eyes.\nEventually, after seeing an advertisement for Barnacle Chips, SpongeBob and Patrick decide to increase the appeal of their product by \"stretching\" the truth. The first customers they use this tactic on are Incidental 87, an old lady, and her very old mother. The mother is so old that she is only a shriveled up spine. They claim that the chocolate will make one immortal by rubbing it on their skin, which the extremely old mother is delighted by to her daughter's dismay. The duo continues this strategy, making several absurd promises about the chocolate. Their lies culminate in them dressing in bandages and pretending to be badly injured and in need of an operation. However, the customer they go to is himself in far worse shape than they claim to be, and must sell chocolate to pay his medical bills. Feeling extreme sympathy for the man, SpongeBob and Patrick buy a huge amount of chocolate from him with all of the money they had just made. However, the man is then revealed to be the same con artist who had scammed them twice before.\nSpongeBob and Patrick, unaware that they have been swindled for the third time, despair since they do not have anyone else to sell chocolate to and decide to give up. Suddenly, Incidental 6 catches up with them again. He approaches them menacingly, but then cheerfully requests to buy all of the chocolate, which leaves SpongeBob and Patrick speechless. SpongeBob and Patrick make a fortune from him, which they use to rent out a fancy restaurant on a double date with Mary and her mother, much to Squidward's shock and disappointment."}

Finally, Mermaid Man orders a Krabby Patty and a Pipsqueak Patty for Barnacle Boy who demands an adult-sized burger, claiming that since he is very old, he should no longer be treated as a child. When Mermaid Man, Squidward, and the Krusty Krab patrons begin to tease him, Barnacle Boy breaks his friendship with Mermaid Man and joins Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble to form a villainous group known as \"E.V.I.L.\" (Every Villain Is Lemons), a group that does immature criminal acts, and he changes his name to Barnacle Man, and they cause trouble acting like crazy kids.\nMermaid Man runs outside of the Krusty Krab, until he stops because he hears an ice cream truck. He orders a double scoop of prune ice cream with bran sprinkles from E.V.I.L., but the ice cream explodes and it's a bomb after he eats it, giving him a hole in his stomach, and they drive off. Mermaid Man then realizes that he cannot defeat this new threat on his own, so he recruits SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Squidward to reform the \"International Justice League of Super Acquaintances.\" SpongeBob becomes the \"Quickster,\" and can run at amazing speed. Squidward becomes \"Captain Magma,\" and gains the power to produce fire and lava. Patrick becomes the \"Elastic Waistband,\" and gains the power to stretch his body to incredible lengths. Sandy becomes \"Miss Appear,\" and can become completely invisible. The Chief informs them that E.V.I.L. is at a teenage gathering spot called Makeout Reef, where they are harassing the teenagers by shining a flashlight on their parked cars while they are making out.\nMermaid Man and his team go to Make-Out Reef and confront the villains, and, despite numerous advantages, the inexperienced Super Acquaintances defeat themselves. Squidward (Captain Magma) accidentally shoots hot lava on SpongeBob's (The Quickster's) head, and the latter starts running around in circles at super-speed as he burns in pain. Patrick (Elastic Waistband) tries to stop him from running, but he gets caught onto SpongeBob and is overstretched. Mermaid Man tries to put out SpongeBob (The Quickster), but mistakes Squidward (Captain Magma) for SpongeBob (The Quickster) and washes him up with a water ball, disintegrating him. Sandy (Miss Appear) disappears to catch E.V.I.L. by surprise, but is hit by a boat from behind and knocked off the cliff. By this time, SpongeBob has completely disintegrated, and all that is left of him are his shoes. Mermaid Man simply falls over backward. Having watched the heroes, Barnacle Man demands three things of Mermaid Man: that he be treated like a superhero, not a sidekick; that he be called \"Barnacle Man\"; and that he be allowed to eat an adult-sized Krabby Patty. He then immediately rejoins the side of good, much to Man-Ray and the Dirty Bubble's dismay.\nThough when the heroes return to the Krusty Krab, Barnacle Man admits an adult-sized Krabby Patty is too big for him. Everyone begins laughing, including SpongeBob and his friends, who are severely injured and supported by medical equipment, the guy at Make-Out Reef who was kissing the pillow, Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble in prison, and the Chief is making out with himself, and he turns around and laughs hysterically, concluding the episode."}

Patrick says that he waits for SpongeBob to get back, and SpongeBob feels sorry for Patrick. SpongeBob then tells Patrick that he can come to school with him.\nThey arrive at 6:20 AM, and class starts at 9:00 AM, which SpongeBob considers \"Late for being early.\" He then shows Patrick around the school and explains their classroom's \"Good Noodle Board\" system, where \"good noodle stars\" are placed on a Good Noodle Board next to the chalkboard. SpongeBob has by far the most stars of anyone in the class, having 74 in total, and adds Patrick's name to the chart so he can start collecting his stars. He also shows to him Roger, an unborn animal egg in a case with only a light-bulb for warmth.\nWhen class starts, Mrs. Puff sees Patrick and asks him his name. He gets nervous and replies with \"twenty-four,\" and the whole class laughs at his response. At their desks, SpongeBob and Patrick laugh among each other about what comes after number \"twenty-four,\" and Mrs. Puff lets Patrick off and warns SpongeBob to pay attention. Later, Patrick draws an ugly picture of Mrs. Puff, calling her a \"Big Fat Meanie,\" and throws it over to SpongeBob's desk. When SpongeBob looks at Patrick's drawing, he gets upset with Patrick and tells him that he cannot do that because Mrs. Puff is the teacher.\nMrs. Puff thinks the picture was made by SpongeBob, and she takes out a small plastic scraper to remove one of his stars from the good noodle board as a punishment, much to SpongeBob's horror. Mrs. Puff then tells SpongeBob to move to the available desk in the back of the room. Soon after, Patrick tries to tell SpongeBob something, and SpongeBob, becoming very irritated, tries to ignore him. Patrick begins spitting spitballs at SpongeBob to get his attention and says that he has \"something important\" to tell him. SpongeBob finally asks him what he has to say, and Patrick simply says \"Hi.\" SpongeBob is furious and screams in frustration. Mrs. Puff angrily tells him that perhaps this would be a good time for recess.\nDuring recess, SpongeBob confronts Patrick in the hallway, and they start fighting (which is fake), so they are both given detention. During detention, the two say how much they hate each other, and SpongeBob says he would hate Patrick even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out. Suddenly, the light bulb goes out, and Roger starts to freeze. Frightened on the inside, SpongeBob and Patrick try to ignore both situations but end up tearfully apologizing, and then they work together to save Roger. SpongeBob keeps the egg warm, while Patrick gets a new light bulb. They both successfully save Roger from his death in the end.\nSuddenly, Mrs. Puff appears, who had been watching the whole incident through her one-way chalkboard. She decides to give them each one a golden star for saving Roger. Patrick then realizes that this was a boating school and not \"Spanish class.\" He leaves, saying goodbye to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff. After Patrick leaves, Roger suddenly hatches from the egg, revealing him to be a live-action chick who asks what he had missed. Then the episode ends."}

He decides to order coral bits, after SpongeBob suggests it, for one dollar, but then an alarm suddenly blares out. Squidward assures the customer that \"It's something stupid,\" and Mr. Krabs bursts out of his office and starts to dance with the recently obtained dollar in his hand to intense celebratory music. Mr. Krabs informs everyone that he has received his millionth dollar, which is every crab's goal in life. He kicks out all of the customers for \"spoiling his moment,\" not even giving Sandals his coral bits, and tells SpongeBob and Squidward that they are going on a surprise trip to celebrate. Squidward asks if they are going to Fancy Springs, Pamper Island, or perhaps Bikini Bottom Folk Village, but Mr. Krabs states it's better than that.\nIt's then revealed that the three of them are going clam fishing on a cheap boat named the S.S. Cheapskate on a smelly lagoon, much to Squidward's disappointment. SpongeBob accidentally removes everything from the boat while he is casting his line, as well as Squidward's shirt and nose, which Mr. Krabs doesn't mind, until SpongeBob's cast hooks onto the back of Mr. Krabs' pants, which he foolishly taped his millionth dollar to, and rips it off. Once the dollar is thrown into the lagoon, dramatic music begins playing, signaling an incoming clam attack, and SpongeBob begins reeling in the dollar as quickly as he can. Mr. Krabs locates the source of the dramatic music: a live-action orchestra playing behind a wooden door. Mr. Krabs yells and begs for them to stop playing, but to no avail. SpongeBob manages to reel it into the boat, and Mr. Krabs grabs the dollar. However, a blue-lipped clam suddenly jumps out of the lagoon, grabs the dollar out of Mr. Krabs' claw, and falls back into the lagoon and swims away. Mr. Krabs childishly wails over this. This continues until Squidward, out of annoyance, states they'll help Mr. Krabs get his dollar back. Mr. Krabs is happy to hear this and gives everyone supplies so that they can prepare themselves for catching the clam. Mr. Krabs then starts keeping a lookout for the clam.\n\"The Team,\" consisting of SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs, works for three days, but the clam doesn't come back. SpongeBob and Squidward have now become tired of waiting for the clam to come, so they attempt to make Mr. Krabs happy by giving him a dollar out of Squidward's wallet. It works at first, but after Mr. Krabs rubs the dollar on his butt like a towel, he becomes suspicious and figures out that it isn't his millionth dollar, but an ordinary dollar that's been crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon, and kissed with Coral Blue #2 semi-gloss lipstick, with Squidward bonking SpongeBob on the head before the latter reveals what the actual number of lipstick was. Mr. Krabs cries again, but Squidward tells him tears won't work this time, so he then nails a sandwich to a flagpole and states that the sandwich will be the reward for the person who can retrieve his dollar from the giant blue-lipped clam. He then tosses all the other sandwiches overboard to make it \"the sandwich.\" Squidward doesn't care, saying that they have plenty more to eat, but he's interrupted by Mr. Krabs dropping the whole fridge overboard. Squidward, and eventually, SpongeBob, now realize that Mr. Krabs has become insane, so Squidward whispers to SpongeBob that they should sneak over to the lifeboat quietly while Mr. Krabs isn't looking. However, they run for their lives to the lifeboat while screaming. Upon entering the lifeboat, Mr. Krabs is revealed to have been secretly inside and that he was hired by the clam to take his crew to the S.S. Cheapskate so he could be eaten after he earned the dollar.\nHe then throws SpongeBob and Squidward out while they're tied together. Mr. Krabs is angry that his own crew would betray him, so he makes SpongeBob and Squidward into live bait by hooking them to his rod. Squidward tells him the clam won't come until Mr. Krabs appears in a conductor's outfit. Soon enough, the dramatic music begins playing again with Krabs being the conductor, and this begins to freak them out. The blue-lipped clam begins swimming toward the boat. Soon enough, the clam opens his mouth and he is then revealed that the dollar is lying on his tongue. Mr. Krabs closes the sliding doors to stop the music, causing the clam to stop moving, so he jumps onto the clam's tongue, grabs the dollar and dances with it. However, the doors open back up and the dramatic music returns, causing the clam to shut his mouth while Mr. Krabs is still in it. The clam then dives back into the lagoon.\nThinking that Mr. Krabs is dead, SpongeBob and Squidward start crying until he is seen at the surface of the lagoon with his dollar. Mr. Krabs reveals that he and the clam fought until they made a trade.

From his cave-house, Patchy the Pirate, in a caveman costume, is introducing prehistoric times and talking about how great they were. However, Potty, in a futuristic robot costume, appears and says that prehistoric times were \"lame\" and the future is \"where it's at.\"\nThey begin arguing over whether SpongeBob himself likes prehistory or the future better. While working at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob feels a disturbance and tells Mr. Krabs that \"I've got the strangest feeling that somewhere a pirate and parrot are arguing about me. And, the parrot is winning.\" As Patchy and Potty continue to argue, Patchy begins the episode.\nThe cartoon features prehistoric ancestors of SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick named \"SpongeGar\", \"Squog\" and \"Patar,\" respectively. SpongeGar, who is sleeping in his pineapple-shaped cave, is awakened by a distant herd of monstrous purple whale creatures, who produce a sound identical to that of SpongeBob's alarm clock that knocks the rock on SpongeGar. SpongeGar wakes up and takes his version of Gary, who is bigger than the prehistoric pineapple itself, out for a walk, and the large sea snail leaves a slime trail all over Squog's front yard. Squog comes out with one of his two clubs to complain to SpongeGar, but slips on the slime trail, sliding into Patar's rock, awakening its occupant, and eventually crashing back into his own house. SpongeGar and Patar begin to play, and SpongeGar uses a hollow log to blow a bubble. It then starts raining, and eventually lightning strikes the log, setting it on fire.\nAs the act ends, the three cavemen experiment with it, burning themselves in the process. Very soon, SpongeGar realizes that it can be used to cook food. The three begin cooking various items with it. These include flowers, the top of a mushroom, a kelp reed, a wood stick, a prehistoric ancestor of Eugene H.

Patchy then brings in a real live caveman, but Potty brings in a futuristic robot who begins repeatedly shooting the caveman with lasers.\nAt the end of the day, SpongeGar, Patar, and Squog are full from eating and say goodbye to each other as they head over to their homes. Suddenly, SpongeGar, Patar and Squog stop walking and they turn around, realizing that the fire is still out there. The three of them start fighting over who will keep the fire. They continue fighting until it starts raining again and puts the fire out. SpongeGar and Patar apologize to each other for fighting, but Squog blames them for putting it out and attempts to hit them over the head. Before he can do so, however, lightning strikes him and SpongeGar and Patar cook marshmallows over his charred body.\nAfter the episode ends, Patchy is shown sitting outside his cave, apparently having lost to Potty. However, Potty comes outside and invites him back in, where Cavey the Caveman and the Robot Android Cyborg DX-294888 do a rap called \"When Worlds Collide.\"\nPatchy began to have a change of heart about \"loving\" the future.

Squidward opens what ends up being a cage, which turns out to contain a female snail named Snellie. He explains that Snellie is a purebred of the highest pedigree and that she is going to be entered in the Bikini Bottom Snail Race on Sunday, which he is sure Snellie will win easily. Upon hearing this, SpongeBob takes offense to Squidward's insult to Gary and decides to enter his pet into the snail race to retaliate against Squidward. Patrick also decides to enter into the competition, albeit with his pet rock, who he christens \"Rocky.\"\nWith only one day to go until the big day, SpongeBob decides to train Gary as hard as possible, and ends up training him practically to the point of exhaustion. On the day of the race, Gary is so exhausted from SpongeBob's brutal training that he is barely able to make it to the stadium. In fact, Gary's exhaustion is so great that he is initially unable to start in the race. During the race, his eyes burst like a balloon, his shell breaks open (like a car engine) and he spins out of control, leaving skid marks. SpongeBob, seeing the error of his ways, tells Gary that he can stop, but Gary keeps on going, loses control of himself, hits the wall, and explodes completely. An upset SpongeBob runs up to him onto the track, which the announcer says is an \"automatic disqualification,\" and embraces him, crying.\nSnellie, who is almost at the finish line, feels sorry for Gary and turns around to comfort him, and the two instantly fall in love. Squidward is shocked at this and walks onto the track. SpongeBob and Squidward then see that, much to their surprise, Patrick's rock has won the race. However, Patrick has the trophy engraved in Squidward's honor knowing how much he wanted to win, and gives it to him. As part of a gag where Squidward's last name is mispronounced throughout the episode, Squidward's name is printed \"Squidward Tortellini\" much to his dismay. Sandy suddenly appears onscreen and ends the episode by kicking SpongeBob into the air for his sexist insult towards Gary the day before."}

Pearl reminds him to take his pill and Mr. Krabs asks if she thinks he is old. Much to his dismay, Pearl says she does. Later in the morning, he is walking along the street and again denies that he is old, but then discovers a boy-scout fish is helping him walk. When Mr. Krabs tries to walk off, his arm comes off into the boy-scout's hands, and Mr. Krabs apologizes.\nAt the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is feeling upset, when he overhears Incidental 103 complaining that his Krabby Patty tastes funny. His mother Incidental 48 tells him that it is 'all old and dried out' in an insulting comparison to Mr. Krabs. Patrick enters the Krusty Krab, and SpongeBob yells at him from the kitchen, asking if he is ready for the big night out, and Patrick yells back saying he is. After Squidward yells at them to keep it down, they continue the conversation in the kitchen, where Mr. Krabs eavesdrops on them from the door to his office. Mr. Krabs asks them if he could come with them on their night out, but Patrick thinks he might cramp their 'style' and he tests Mr. Krabs to see if he knows the \"secret cool guy hand shake.\" It turns out he does, and Patrick says he is in.\nAt 8:01 PM, SpongeBob and Patrick arrive at Mr. Krabs' house as part of their \"fashionably late\" promise, ready for the big night out. They first go to The Wash! to watch their faces spin in the mirror reflection of a washing machine, but Mr. Krabs is not amused by this activity and wants to see more of the night life. The scene then changes to them doing many other bizarre activities in various settings such as at the library, dentist, and highway, none of which have yet succeeded in amusing Mr. Krabs.\nFinally, they are at a children's arcade called Bunny Buns, and SpongeBob once again asks if Mr. Krabs is feeling it. Multiple kids at once ask him this over and over, and then Mr. Krabs gets angry and berates the incidentals for embarrassing him, and then SpongeBob and Patrick for taking him out on a series of bizarre occurrences which do not live up to their promise of coolness and call them names. He then decides to cancel the night and go home, but Patrick tries to change his mind by saying that he will miss out on the \"Panty Raid,\" an occurrence in which the trio will be invading a woman's house at night to steal her underpants. It is at this moment that Mr. Krabs reconsiders and has finally found a highlight of his night out.\nSpongeBob, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs arrive at a house, and are successful in obtaining an unspecified woman's underwear. However, they are caught red-handed when the woman turns on the light and catches the boys in the middle of the act, revealing her to be Mr. Krabs' mother. As a result, Mr. Krabs is grounded and sent to his room, being assisted by the boy scout. SpongeBob apologizes for what happened, and Mr. Krabs tells him it was fine, as being in his old bedroom made him feel younger. As the camera pans to show Mr. Krabs' room as a child.

{"prompt": "Born Again Krabs", "completion": "One day, it is closing time at the Krusty Krab, and Squidward is obviously delighted at being free of work, while a sad SpongeBob is not. He soon finds an old, blackened, moldy Krabby Patty under the grill, and he tries to throw it out. However, this triggers an alarm, and Mr. Krabs will not let him throw out the patty, as serving it will give him 5.2 cents, and he orders SpongeBob \"not to make another patty until that one is sold.\"\nThe next day, Squidward is informed of the decision, and reluctantly holds out the rancid patty to the customer. The customer takes one sniff of the patty, screams in disgust, and backflips out the door.\nSure enough, this results in the Krusty Krab losing many weeks' worth of business. Mr. Krabs wonders if it is the new place mats, but Squidward angrily tells his boss it is the old rotten patty he keeps trying to serve to everyone. The stubborn Mr. Krabs dismisses such a notion and has SpongeBob bring it out. SpongeBob reveals that he has caged it since it became sentient enough to growl at him. Mr. Krabs decides to prove his views by eating the patty, though before he eats it he sees an ambulance passing the Krusty Krab (mostly because the people already know he will get sick from eating it). He eats the spoiled moldy patty, and he is promptly rushed to the hospital minutes later while now green. As he is being wheeled in, Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to wrap up the rest of the patty because he still thinks it is worth eating, while the latter worries over his boss.\nSoon in the hospital, the Flying Dutchman appears to condemn him in Davy Jones' locker for his cheap actions. Mr. Krabs falsely claims his name is \"Harold Flower,\" but the Dutchman gets confirmation from the nurse that he is lying. When they arrive at the locker, Mr. Krabs begs to be freed. The Dutchman agrees to do this, as long as he will always be generous from then on, and Mr. Krabs promises.\nAt the Krusty Krab (which went bankrupt and ended up going out of business due to the amount of business lost and Krabs' absence), Squidward is going through his boss' belongings while a tearful SpongeBob believes he will come back, though his co-worker is not convinced by the doctor's word. At that moment, Mr. Krabs returns to the Krusty Krab and his employees are shocked to see him again. SpongeBob celebrates as Squidward is deadpan, but Mr. Krabs promises to be less cheap and more generous.\nRe-opening his restaurant, Mr. Krabs begins to treat everyone nicer with the \"employee lounge\" and free refills. But soon, SpongeBob and Squidward become concerned when Mr. Krabs is not the least bit fazed when he receives a $10,000 hospital bill and does not have any money in the register to pay for it. When they tell Mr. Krabs how weird he has been acting, he states that he is having a nightmare and that there is nothing to worry about, much to their shock and confusion. After Squidward and SpongeBob tell him otherwise, he realizes that the whole thing was real and starts to read the real bill and panics while his head breaks and grows again. He now becomes a cheapskate once more and revokes all the free things he gave to the customers and threatens to rip off one's arm over a penny. The Dutchman then returns to take him back to the Locker for eternity, but SpongeBob bets that Mr. Krabs is generous, and bets that he would pick him over all the money in The Dutchman's pocket. Mr. Krabs promptly takes the money, sending a heartbroken SpongeBob to Davy Jones' locker. Squidward is shocked and outraged at Mr. Krabs for selling SpongeBob's soul for 62 cents and chews him out that he should be ashamed of himself! Mr. Krabs sees the error of his ways and rejects the money for another chance, because he learns a lesson of what it's like to be Krusty Krab without SpongeBob; because without him, there will be no Krabby Patties to cook and he will never get more money, the Krusty Krab will never get the best ratings higher than the Chum Bucket and Plankton will steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. The Flying Dutchman then returns with SpongeBob, not because of Mr. Krabs' repenting, but because SpongeBob was WAY too annoying due to his talkative nature and he believes that letting Mr. Krabs have SpongeBob in his life would be \"a fate worse than death.\"\nMr. Krabs apologizes to SpongeBob for his petty act, but the latter dismisses it as he would do the same, but promptly denies it, and the crew laughs. At the end of the episode, the Flying Dutchman is seen reading near the locker when the phone rings. The caller is revealed to be SpongeBob, who begins to annoy the Flying Dutchman again with his consistent chatting."}

It turns out Patrick is playing a video game, but the same thing that happened to the character in the game soon happens to him. Sandy warns SpongeBob not to play games and board, then SpongeBob begins to board. While sandboarding, SpongeBob does a stunt called \"The Grouchy Squidward,\" with the real Squidward telling SpongeBob not to make moves based around him. While doing this stunt, he almost crashes into a land tree. He then turns around to tell Sandy that everything is fine, but he then loses control of the board and is sent flying. He then begins to plummet to the ground, and Sandy tells him to land on his bottom. SpongeBob does so, but his bottom shatters into many pieces and he is rushed to the hospital.\nThe Purple Doctorfish says that it took 20 hours to glue it back together and that if he has another similar injury, he may end up in the \"iron butt,\" which is a huge machine on wheels connected to where the butt used to be. SpongeBob goes on \"around-the-clock butt patrol.\" However, it seems the entire outside world is out to break his butt, as he passes a football pitch where players are slapped on the butt and a spanking machine.\nEventually, SpongeBob cannot take it anymore and decides to stay home forever with his \"potato chip,\" the \"penny\" that has never been used, and a \"tissue napkin\" that has been truly used. Sandy and Patrick ask SpongeBob if he wants to go shuffleboarding again, but he tells them that he will never go outside again. Sandy then says that they will find an activity that is so fun, he will have to go outside. They try a cake that SpongeBob must leave the house to blow out the candles on, jellyfishing, ice-creams, trampolines, and even giving an old person a bath, but nothing works. SpongeBob then sings a song about the joys of staying indoors, which makes Sandy very frustrated.\nSandy comes up with a plan to have Patrick put on a gorilla suit and pretend to attack her so that SpongeBob will have to come out and save her. SpongeBob is unconvinced by this and knows it is Patrick, until what appears to be another Patrick Star eating ice cream appears on the scene and questions Sandy to everyone's shock. Sandy questions the second Patrick on him not being in costume, but Patrick reveals that he is in the costume. Sandy asks if he is the real Patrick, then who the other Patrick is. The second Patrick pulls down a zipper, revealing him to be an actual live-action gorilla. He then stuffs the screaming Sandy and Patrick into a bag, attacks them, and beats them up. SpongeBob is horrified by the display, and initially tells his friends he warned them of the danger and does not want to risk going outside to save them, but Chip 'reminds him' that if it was him being attacked by a gorilla, Sandy and Patrick would try to save him.\nConvinced by this, SpongeBob finally leaves the safety of his home to save his friends, but the gorilla grabs him and splits him in half. Admitting that them being attacked by a gorilla was all his fault, SpongeBob apologizes to his friends for being stubborn on coming outside and admits he is over it while terrified of gorillas. They forgive him and say that they are terrified of gorillas as well. When SpongeBob asks how a gorilla can exist underwater, the gorilla, who reveals that he can talk, tries to explain before calling his friend George, and he rides on him to flee the scene as SpongeBob's two halves, Sandy, and Patrick watch him and George ride away into the sunset. After they watch the horse and the gorilla run off, a live-action family, who stares at each other in confusion, turns off the TV to end the episode."}

When he goes to work, he sees Mr. Krabs even more excited for summer. SpongeBob asks him why, and he says that on summer vacation, children go around spending money, and the Krusty Krab will get more profits through kiddie meals, which he raises the price of from $1.99 to $4.99. However, he sees that the children are all at a new playground, and decides to make a playground of his own called Krabby Land.\nAt work the next day, Mr. Krabs reveals the grand opening of Krabby Land, which he proudly built himself. When it is uncovered, it is revealed to be little more than a dopey-looking assembly of cheap and dangerous attractions. The children are horrified, yet speechless with disappointment, but Mr. Krabs gives them coloring books/liability waivers and says that whoever hands theirs back gets to meet \"Krabby the Clown.\" He tells them that the clown will come soon, and tells SpongeBob to stall the kids while he counts the money.\nSpongeBob pretends to be Krabby's sidekick, \"the Krabby Patty Burglar,\" but the children hate him. He accidentally injures himself while trying to amuse them by blowing bubbles and getting soap liquid in his eyes, which makes the kids laugh. He realizes that the kids like it when he is in pain, and begins intentionally harming himself, even hiring two thugs to torture him by feeding him lima beans.\nAfter a while, SpongeBob goes to Mr. Krabs, who is sorting through a large stack of money, and tells him that he cannot stall the children anymore, being horribly beaten and missing limbs. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob he is being selfish and tells him to \"get back there and stall,\" but upon seeing SpongeBob's limbs flying around, he fears that his windows will be smashed, so he tells him to let the crowd of children enter the restaurant for Krabby the Clown's arrival. Excited, the children and SpongeBob rush in front of Mr. Krabs, who welcomes Krabby the Clown. However, it turns out that Mr. Krabs turns around and immediately puts on a bow tie and a blue-painted tomato on his nose, and does a cheap imitation of the clown. He then walks back into his office, leaving the children and SpongeBob jaw-dropped in confusion. This latest rip-off is the last straw for the children.\nAn extremely disappointed SpongeBob confronts Mr. Krabs, expressing his disdain for such a rip-off. Mr. Krabs undresses from his costume and finally says to SpongeBob that he does not care about the children, but for their money and is willing to do whatever it takes to get their money, and even calls the kids stupid and foolish enough to be the victims of his scam. He then taunts SpongeBob for being unable to stop him in time by saying twice, \"Survival of the fittest.\"\nMr. Krabs tries to go to the bank with the money he has made, but he is confronted by an angry mob of children who have overheard his confession and are planning to punish him. Mr. Krabs, realizing that he is about to be punished and has given the kids his confession which was not taken well, tries to reconcile, but fails as the kids charge, beat him up, and destroy the playground.\nInside, SpongeBob is bewailed that he will never learn the true meaning of summer. Monroe then calls SpongeBob over about the summer miracle, where the kids take back all their money and distribute it back to themselves. SpongeBob guesses it is the true meaning of summer, but he asks Squidward where Mr. Krabs is, who is missing out the summer fun. The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs, tied on fours between wooden poles, who warns to return his \"green stuff\" and begs for freedom. However, the episode ends with the thugs, paid by the children for his swindling, reply to him with a can of lima beans and a truckload of them, causing him distress by the torture like what SpongeBob did earlier — only to learn not to underestimate the kids."}
{"prompt": "The Camping Episode", "completion": "The episode begins with Squidward in his house preparing for bed as he looks forward to a weekend of peace and quiet, especially with SpongeBob and Patrick deciding to go camping. However, he is extremely exasperated and disappointed to learn that they are camping in SpongeBob's front yard, right outside his window.\nSquidward confronts SpongeBob and Patrick in their tent, pointing out they cannot be \"camping\" if they are only ten feet away from SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob simply states that it does not matter where you camp, as long as you are in the wilderness. After getting the impression that the duo believe Squidward is not manly or qualified enough to camp, he impulsively decides to join SpongeBob and Patrick in their \"camping.\" Squidward attempts to demonstrate \"real camping\" as SpongeBob and Patrick take notes, but fails to set up his automated tent, so he decides to sleep under the stars.\nThe gang begins roasting marshmallows while imitating astronauts. Squidward dismisses them and plans to get a can opener from his house so he can eat a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls. However, SpongeBob stops him from doing so, saying that \"it just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit.\" Squidward grudgingly decides to eat the marshmallows, but Patrick repeatedly blows on his burned ones, sending them flying into Squidward's face. SpongeBob then plays the \"Campfire Song Song.\" Squidward dislikes it and begins playing \"Kumbayah\" very badly on his clarinet. Suddenly, a terrified SpongeBob stops Squidward by shooting a marshmallow through his clarinet and into his windpipe, causing him to choke.\nAfter Squidward recovers, he yells at SpongeBob for hurting him. He claims that it is not safe to play the clarinet badly in the wilderness at night, as he might attract a sea bear. Squidward angrily protests that sea bears do not exist, but SpongeBob and Patrick insist that they are real, showing various newspaper articles of Fake Science Monthly as proof. Squidward attempts to disprove their existence by having SpongeBob and Patrick list all the things which supposedly attract sea bears, such as eating cheese cubes, wearing a hoop skirt and clown shoes, waving a flashlight, etc. He then begins doing all these actions at once, despite SpongeBob and Patrick's pleas. He quickly draws an \"anti-sea-bear circle\" in the dirt to protect himself and Patrick.\nSquidward then gloats how a sea bear has not arrived, to which SpongeBob explains he forgot one thing: wearing a sombrero in a \"goofy fashion.\" Just then, a real sea bear appears and demonstrates how the hat should be worn, much to Squidward's horror. The bear mauls the shocked Squidward before leaving. SpongeBob and Patrick urge Squidward to jump into their circle, but he is skeptical of this and tries to flee, only to be attacked by the sea bear again for various reasons.\nAfter being attacked for the sixth time, SpongeBob concludes the sea bear simply does not like Squidward. After failing to draw his own anti-sea-bear circle, it became an oval! So Squidward finally leaps into SpongeBob and Patrick's. When the sea-bear appears again, it notices Squidward is now in the circle and growls at him in warning for now being safe, before leaving the area. Squidward is relieved the creature is finally gone and thanks SpongeBob and Patrick for saving his life as the trio celebrate.\nSpongeBob mentions they are lucky to not be attacked by a sea rhinoceros. Hearing this, Squidward fearfully asks what attracts them, to which Patrick replies, \"The sound of a sea bear attack.\" A sea rhinoceros then appears and growls at Squidward. SpongeBob then wraps up the episode by remarking how lucky they all are to be wearing anti-sea rhinoceros undergarments, except for Squidward, who does not have a pair on, causing him to whimper in resignation and fear."}

A patron is solving a crossword puzzle and realizes that he has lost his pen. A waitress says he can borrow hers, and he does. It then shows SpongeBob sitting at a table, who says he once lost something he could not live without: his identity.\nEven though no one asked or wants to know, he recounts the events of last Monday. In the flashback, he wakes up and throws his blanket into the air, and says \"Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it!\" The blanket falls on him, and SpongeBob, being unable to see, falls off of his bed, and his alarm clock falls on top of his head. He falls down the stairs and the alarm propels him into the window. He feeds Gary and comments that he has been feeding Gary snail food for years and does not even know what it tastes like. He tastes it, is revolted, and his screaming of disgust is sensed at the headquarters of the company that makes the snail food. He looks at the clock and realizes that he is late for work, and quickly gets changed and skips to work. While he is skipping to work, Patrick greets SpongeBob.\nAfter SpongeBob tells the diner people about greeting Patrick, he decides to skip to the part when he was about to serve a customer. \nLater, as SpongeBob serves food to a customer, the customer tells him that he should wear a name tag so that she can thank him properly. He indicates that he is indeed wearing a name tag, but then realizes that his name tag is missing. He panics, hyperventilates, and eventually faints.\nWhen he wakes up, he asks Squidward what happened. Squidward tells him that he fainted because he lost his name tag, but he assures him that his name tag is not that important, and SpongeBob hyperventilates once again until Squidward stops him, saying it is not the end of the world. However, just as he says this, Mr. Krabs comes out of his office and informs them that there is a uniform inspection in one hour and anyone who fails has to wear a very stinky boot all day. Squidward suggests to SpongeBob that he should retrace his steps.\nSpongeBob repeats everything he did that morning several times, including his \"horrific incident of terror\" with the alarm clock and eating the snail food. SpongeBob repeats this many times since Patrick continuously fails to say \"Hi\" to him. As an example, Patrick accidentally says \"Hi, SpongeBoob\" and laughs afterward. Still, SpongeBob fails to find his name tag. Patrick asks him if he did anything else on his way to work before noticing he lost his name tag, and SpongeBob says that he skipped merrily to Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins, put an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk, and was thrown into a dumpster by two thugs. Patrick predicts his name tag is in the apple he placed on Mr. Krabs' desk. SpongeBob likes Patrick's prediction, but claims Mr. Krabs has probably thrown that apple away by now, so Patrick suggests looking in the dumpster, and they go to search there.\nDuring the search, SpongeBob gives Patrick two hints but he is still confused. SpongeBob does a double-take of Jack Benny while wondering, but panics that he has one minute left. Patrick finds SpongeBob's name tag on the back of his shirt, and when he alerts him to this and SpongeBob turns around, it seems to disappear and Patrick cannot remember where it was. SpongeBob gets irritated after he does this twice, and he soon tells Patrick to go home since he is no help. However, after an annoyed Patrick says \"At least I don't wear my shirt backwards!,\" SpongeBob sees this and realizes that he had his name tag all along, and his shirt was just on backward. At the uniform inspection, however, Mr. Krabs smells SpongeBob and is disgusted by the stench of the dumpster, and seemingly suspends him from working at the Krusty Krab.\nAs the episode ends with SpongeBob finishing telling his story, and thanking the waitress for listening and explaining that he managed to kill eleven minutes, calling her \"Betty,\" she says that her name is not Betty and that she is just borrowing someone else's uniform while hers is getting cleaned.

They attack Mr. Krabs and Squidward and trap them both before opening the safe containing the Krabby Patty secret formula. Plankton pulls it out of the safe and Mr. Krabs begs him not to read it, telling him, \"There's some things in this world that weren't meant for mortal eyes!\" Plankton refuses to listen and reads it anyway: \nHorrified at this, Plankton stares at Krabs who repeats he warned him before Plankton runs out of the Krusty Krab and back to the Chum Bucket, screaming at the top of his lungs. All his relatives notice the picture of him in the recipe book and quickly follow him out too. Clem, being illiterate stays behind, causing Krabs to send him off too.\nAs SpongeBob returns from cleaning the bathroom, Squidward asks if this is really the secret ingredient.

Patchy is taking a shower, and he says that he has lost the (already) lost episode, and tells the children to forget about SpongeBob. The French narrator introduces a segment called \"Remembering SpongeBob\". a musical montage of clips from past episodes from the first three seasons.\nSuddenly, a map revealing the location of the lost episode is launched through Patchy's window. After a long treasure hunt, Patchy finds the tape that holds the episode, but sees a several-minute clip of SpongeBob doing cheap walk cycles in a straight line followed by SMPTE color bars. Thinking that SpongeBob has \"betrayed\" him, Patchy decides to get rid of all his SpongeBob merchandise and run away from home. However, when he leaves the house, the countdown to the real lost episode starts. Potty quickly alerts Patchy of this news and he quickly runs back in, puts his SpongeBob stuff back, and sits down to watch with Potty.\nThe SpongeBob episode segment begins at Jellyfish Fields with SpongeBob wishing he could fly with the jellyfish. He makes several attempts to do so, including a biplane, bat wings, a garden chair with balloons, and a giant kite pulled by a bicycle, some of these attempts assisted by Patrick. After his failed attempts are witnessed by others, he becomes known as \"The Birdman of Bikini Bottom\" and is ridiculed. He tells the people that he is sad to be ridiculed for trying to live up to his dreams. The townspeople tell him that they all once had unfulfilled dreams, then they proceed to form a mob and start chasing him for thinking he is more important than them. The act ends when SpongeBob runs off a cliff and falls into a truck of mud, then into a truck of feathers, much to his misfortune.\nLater on, Act 2 begins by showing SpongeBob in his house, having given up on his dream. He begins to dry his \"hair,\" then he receives an insulting phone call from a \"fan\" of the \"Birdman,\" namely, \"Joe Momma.\" SpongeBob puts the hairdryer in his pants while he talks, and the dryer inflates his pants, giving him the ability to fly. He goes around helping people, earning their admiration, and becoming a local celebrity of sorts. However, the lazy citizens continue to ask increasingly unnecessary favors of him, particularly those which do not require flight, leaving him no time to fly with the jellyfish. When he tries to escape to Jellyfish Fields, the people form a mob and chase him, but are unable to catch him. However, Cannonball Jenkins blasts SpongeBob, destroying the pants and sending him plummeting to the ground. The people seem as though they are mourning SpongeBob's death, but they are really mourning the inflatable pants.\nAfter they take his pants and leave, SpongeBob is about to go home, but suddenly, the jellyfish help him fly. They take him home as he sings an intentionally corny song about how all one needs to fly is friendship. As he says goodbye to the jellyfish, Patrick greets SpongeBob and offers him a trip to the Pizza House. SpongeBob declines and leaves it up to the jellyfish for flying. Patrick then flies off as a superhero does, with his regular, uninflated pants. A confused SpongeBob wonders if Patrick just flew, only for him to doubt it because of how silly and impossible that seems. The episode ends as he looks after Patrick out of curiosity.\nAfter the episode, Patchy attempts to play it again but he does not know how to rewind it to the beginning. He and Potty press a lot of buttons on the remote, causing the VCR to malfunction and spit the tape which entangles Patchy. Thus, the lost episode is lost forever and the scene changes to an exterior shot of Patchy's house, but now at nighttime, the narrator assures the audience that whether or not the lost episode will remain lost, as long as there are stars in the sky, SpongeBob will live on in fans' hearts and minds.

They assure him that they have locked down while the latter makes it clear he is coming for him.\nSeconds later, the Strangler escapes and begins planning to kill SpongeBob as a revenge for calling the cops on him. SpongeBob begs the officers for protection from the serial killer, but they leave him to his devices, calling him a \"tattletale.\" SpongeBob looks for a bodyguard for protection, but no one will take the job knowing that they would have to face the Strangler. He decides to go into hiding until the Strangler gives up on him, but then a man, who is the Strangler using a fake mustache as a disguise, offers to take the job, intending to lead SpongeBob to a place where he can kill him with no other witnesses. SpongeBob, seemingly oblivious to his identity, hires him. However, SpongeBob needs to run some errands first.\nWhen they finally arrive at SpongeBob's house, the lights then turn on, revealing a \"100% on-time average\" surprise party. The party goes on for a considerable length of time. Once it ends, the Strangler then attempts to choke him again, but the guests come back for a birthday party for SpongeBob. After the party ends and the two are finally alone, he tries again, but then Patrick shows up for some odd reason. The Strangler tries to get rid of him, saying that he could be the Strangler in disguise. Patrick then runs off thinking that he is the Strangler, breaking through the wall and running off to turn himself in.\nSpongeBob is confused upon realizing that Patrick is the Strangler. The real Strangler, enraged, reveals his true identity and intentions by removing his disguise. However, SpongeBob still seemingly fails to understand and is amazed at the Strangler being able to tear off his mustache without shaving cream. The latter yells at him that it is a fake he bought at the party store. The guests return upon overhearing the word \"party.\" Annoyed and frustrated, the Strangler runs away, but SpongeBob goes after him, saying he still needs protection from the \"bodyguard.\" He attempts to escape in a series of vehicles, but SpongeBob catches up every time.\nEventually, the Strangler lands in the police department in a jail cell and SpongeBob learns the truth after he is directed to a wanted poster. As SpongeBob finally realizes the truth, the police congratulate him for putting the Strangler behind bars. The Strangler is happy to be away from SpongeBob at first, but then he soon finds himself with Patrick, who is in his cell, asking what he is in for, much to Strangler's dismay."}

Patrick falls for the Seanut Brittle prank again before SpongeBob introduces Patrick to the store owner, Frank, who then suggests numerous gags in stock to prank all of Bikini Bottom with, though none of them interest the pair until they are offered a rare can of Invisible Spray for just one dollar.\nSpongeBob and Patrick then proceed to purchase it and are warned that it stains clothes. Before they use the spray, Patrick remembers it will stain clothes, so he and SpongeBob take their clothes off in order to prevent the spray from staining their clothes. They decide to spray a park bench and sit on it but get in an argument over who gets to spray the bench. During the fight, they are embarrassed by a passing tour bus before they spray each other until \"several bad puns later,\" after which both of them are completely invisible and the Invisible Spray can is empty. SpongeBob throws it out of sight and blames Patrick since their chances at pulling off the ultimate prank are now ruined.\nAfter asking a man for the time and accidentally scaring him away, SpongeBob realizes that he and Patrick can pretend to be ghosts and prank the whole town. They pretend to be ghosts and go around frightening everyone - moving things around in Sandy's treedome, eating a cake Mrs. Puff was going to eat, painting a mustache on Squidward's face, etc. - until Mr. Krabs, who is confirmed not to be afraid of ghosts, is the last person in Bikini Bottom who has yet to be haunted.\nThey attempt to frighten him and succeed until they attempt to burn a dollar bill. Mr. Krabs' fear is overcome by his love of money, and he attempts to extinguish the match with a bucket of water.

It is then revealed Plankton opened his restaurant 23 hours as part of his plan to get SpongeBob to collapse from exhaustion so that he'll be tired enough to tell him the formula.\nAfter ten days of nonstop service, Plankton sees SpongeBob is not exhausted, so he calls Mr. Krabs using a fake name, Dr. Peter Lankton, to order 10,000 Krabby Patties so he can get SpongeBob's mind to crack from exhaustion and make him tell him the formula. Mr. Krabs gives the order to SpongeBob, but after 43 days of cooking, he starts cooking Krabby Patties the wrong way.\nWhen Mr. Krabs comes to check up on SpongeBob, he sees his boss as a Krabby Patty, scaring him. When he goes outside, he visualizes everyone as killer Krabby Patties and starts panicking. When Mr. Krabs sees that SpongeBob is somehow afraid of Krabby Patties now as evidenced by him screaming at the sight of them, he realizes something is wrong with his head and tells him he should go to a psychiatrist to find out why.\nAt the same time, Plankton secretly gives a flier to SpongeBob to come to his place so he can get the formula, with him thinking he is a chipper, fun-loving, upbeat, honest, goofy, cheerful, optimistic, emotional, sentimental, and bipolar psychiatrist who is not evil. He tries several methods, but fails to get SpongeBob to tell the formula due to his fear and improper ways of participating.\nEventually, Plankton uses hypnosis to get the formula out of SpongeBob, but this ends up curing his phobia, as it gives him a dream where he conquers his fears.

Meanwhile, outside the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs calls SpongeBob into his \"Hidey Hole\" under the dumpster, where he keeps his belongings from when he was in the Navy in a treasure chest.\nAfter taking the chest into his office, Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob about his days as \"Armor Abs Krabs\", the nickname he was given due to his tough armor. He explains that that night, he is having a Navy reunion and is going to see all his tough and manly Navy buddies. Afterwards, SpongeBob leaves the office, but suddenly Mr. Krabs let out a wail of despair. Walking back into the office, he finds Mr. Krabs' shell, completely empty, and finds Mr. Krabs himself, naked and squishy.\nMr. Krabs explains he grew too big for his shell and molted, and is now in despair because he no longer looks tough or manly, looking \"pink and soft\". After a little bit of slapstick, SpongeBob accidentally launches into Mr. Krabs' shell, which gives Mr. Krabs an idea: for SpongeBob to impersonate him at the reunion, as SpongeBob can also do a convincing impression of his voice.\nLater, at the reunion, SpongeBob initially puts on a convincing performance, but goes onstage to accept his \"Trophy of Manly Toughness.\" He tells a story of him jellyfishing in Jellyfish Fields, and nearly reveals his true identity, before Mr. Krabs tells him to get offstage.\nHe attempts to leave, but Torpedo Belly insists that he body-slam him to test if he still has \"armor abs.\" When he punches SpongeBob, he flies around the room, cracking the shell and revealing SpongeBob. They get angry, but the real Mr. Krabs emerges from the bush that he had been watching from and reveals himself. He begins to walk away in shame, until Muttonchop gives him back his trophy, saying that revealing his condition was the manliest thing anyone could ever do, and revealing that they have all had unmanly secrets as well: Muttonchop's sideburns are fake, Torpedo Belly had his torpedo removed long ago after his retirement from the Navy, Lockjaw Jones lost his Navy choppers and now has to wear dentures, and Iron Eye's eye is actually made of Formica.\nAs the episode closes with Mr. Krabs walking away with SpongeBob, he says \"Yeah, poor suckers.

{"prompt": "The Lost Mattress", "completion": "In the opening, SpongeBob and Squidward arrive at the Krusty Krab, only to find out it has not opened yet. SpongeBob becomes saddened by this, until a very cranky Mr. Krabs comes after throwing out his back due to his old, lumpy mattress. SpongeBob suggests that he and Squidward buy him a new one, but because he does not want to waste his hard-earned money on his cheapskate boss, Squidward refuses, so Patrick joins SpongeBob in buying a new mattress instead. The two go to a massive mattress emporium, where they buy a comfortable new mattress to replace his old one.\nThey make a card for him, which Squidward signs, giving himself full credit for the gift, as he expects a reward. The next night, the trio surprise Mr. Krabs with his new mattress. When Squidward reveals to Mr. Krabs that he had his old mattress thrown away to the dump, Mr. Krabs gets furious at him, revealing that all of his money was in that mattress. Krabs then goes into a \"Cash Coma,\" and ends up in the hospital, where the doctor explains that only the return of his money can save his life. Squidward insists that it was SpongeBob's fault, but a police officer shows him the card saying, \"This was all MY idea, love Squidward.\", which states that he is solely responsible. The cop says that if Krabs dies, Squidward will be charged for his death and sent to jail. Squidward begins to threaten to kill SpongeBob, but the police officer stops him from doing so.\nSquidward, SpongeBob, and Patrick go to the dump to retrieve the mattress, only to find that there is a vicious guard worm sleeping on top of it.\nMeanwhile, the doctor realizes that Mr. Krabs has no insurance and cannot afford his hospital room, so he moves him into the hallway in front of the vending machines.\nAt the dump, Squidward tells SpongeBob and Patrick to go inside and get the mattress after warning them not to wake the worm, since it will attack. They climb the fence, but they end up becoming distracted by the view, causing an angry Squidward to shake and overturn the fence, accidentally trapping him inside and waking the worm, who promptly mauls him, much to SpongeBob and Patrick's horror.\nAt the hospital, the doctors \"surgically remove\" Mr. Krabs from the building and leave him on the sidewalk to get to the \"Nutty Nut Bar,\" a candy bar in the vending machines he is blocking.\nSquidward then devises another plan, where SpongeBob and Patrick distract the worm and get attacked by him while he retrieves the mattress. The worm however, becomes obedient to SpongeBob when he sees the wooden spoon he is holding up. SpongeBob unintentionally throws it towards Squidward for the worm to fetch, and Squidward is subsequently attacked by the worm once again.\nBack at the hospital, Administrator Flotsam is outraged that Mr. Krabs has been left outside on the sidewalk, and they push him down the hill. Next, Squidward has SpongeBob and Patrick dress as \"choice cuts\" so that the worm will eat them, telling them that they are in Halloween costumes and that when they say trick-or-treat to the worm, he will realize that he forgot about Halloween and will leave to go get candy so they can take the mattress, which is obviously false and only meant for the worm to attack them instead of him.\nWhen Squidward expresses his certainty he will be not be hurt this time, Mr. Krabs suddenly rolls into the dump, running over Squidward, and lands on his old mattress, reviving him. He effortlessly throws the worm aside. Mr. Krabs notices SpongeBob and Patrick and growls at them, but they tell him it is them, and Mr. Krabs asks why they are dressed as meat. SpongeBob tells him that they are not just meat, but also choice cuts.\nSquidward gives up trying to get the worm to attack them, and the worm then lands in Squidward's arms, and begins chasing him out of the dump and down the road Mr. Krabs came from as the episode ends."}

When he goes inside, he slips on the floor where SpongeBob just mopped and is ridiculed by Mr. Krabs. Two customers observing the incident comment that there should have be a wet floor sign and that they would sue Krabs for everything he possesses if that happened to them, including the Krabby Patty secret formula. Plankton then pretends to be badly injured and, after paramedics come and pick him up, Plankton threatens to sue Mr. Krabs unless he gives him the formula, but Mr. Krabs angrily refuses.\nFearing that he will lose the case, Mr. Krabs hires a lawyer named Richard A. Bottomfeeder, who tells him that he will not charge him anything unless they win and that they will counter-sue Plankton for everything he owns. Later, in Mr. Krabs' office, SpongeBob wants to read his testimony speech to Mr. Krabs. However, Mr. Krabs declines SpongeBob's testimony and tells him that he could be more of a liability than an asset. Unfortunately, as they prepare to leave for the court hearing, Richard slips and falls, breaking his back. He gives SpongeBob his briefcase, saying that they only need what is inside the briefcase to win the case. SpongeBob takes Richard's suit and arrives late to the trial, dubbing himself \"SpongeBob LawyerPants\" to Judge Stickleback.\nWhen the plaintiff Plankton first takes the stand, however, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs realize that Richard did not give them the combination of the suitcase. Plankton comes to court in a wheelchair and a few casts and bandages, and gives a convincingly painful testimony, dishonestly earning the sympathy of the jury. Meanwhile, SpongeBob desperately tries crazier and crazier attempts to open the briefcase, but to no avail. Plankton uses the fact that Krabs does not own a \"wet floor\" sign as evidence against him, while SpongeBob only inadvertently demonstrates Krabs' unhealthy greed in his attempts to defend him. Mr. Krabs also accuses Plankton of being a fake, but the courtroom goes against Krabs, not seeing Plankton's more apparent dishonesty. SpongeBob then calls Squidward to the stand, but Squidward testifies against Mr. Krabs, saying that this is his first day off in three years.\nDisheartened, Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to give up, but SpongeBob refuses and gives a short sermon telling him that they cannot quit now. When he finishes, he hits the case lightly, and it opens unexpectedly. They peer inside, only to find a Krabby Patty. Suddenly realizing that they can win the lawsuit once and for all with this, SpongeBob calls Plankton back to the stand and entices him into confessing his attempted theft with the Krabby Patty, eventually getting Plankton to expose his true actions. Plankton runs for the exit with the Krabby Patty, but is quickly stopped by Mr. Krabs, who eats it, much to Plankton's dismay. The judge asks the jury to go into deliberation and they find Mr. Krabs not guilty, though they still proclaim that he is admittedly cheap. Plankton is then arrested off-screen.\nMr. Krabs thanks SpongeBob and apologizes for not accepting his help in the first place. SpongeBob then gives Mr. Krabs a homemade \"wet floor\" sign, riddled with nails and a shoddy paint job. Mr. Krabs, while initially surprised, accepts the gift because it is free as the episode closes."}

However, he is too distracted by the scented pine cones, so he never tells SpongeBob about seeing Gary. \nAfterwards, SpongeBob and Patrick start putting up posters and messages all over town in hopes of finding Gary, and this event is followed by a song set to a montage of SpongeBob and Patrick unsuccessfully finding the snail, even missing him at certain points where they are actually in the same place Gary and Granny are.

PennyPincher of Vending Supplies. Mr. Krabs is overjoyed as the delivery men bring the Skill Crane that he ordered for the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs explains that it will \"pay for itself in no time\" and insists that SpongeBob and Squidward try it, giving them each a free quarter.\nSquidward plays the machine and almost picks up a stuffed snake, but drops it and loses. He excitedly exclaims to SpongeBob that he almost got a toy on his first try. When SpongeBob tries the machine, Squidward expects him to lose, but SpongeBob effortlessly wins two times, winning a stuffed animal with each try.\nLater on, SpongeBob continues to win several more stuffed animals from the machine effortlessly. Squidward desperately tries to win. After running out of money, Mr. Krabs turns Squidward's paycheck into quarters and gives to him. Even using his money from payday, he still does not win. At the same time, SpongeBob receives his regular paycheck.\nWhen Squidward goes home, he finds he cannot pick up anything because of the crane, and he caves in, convinced he must win. He puts back on his normal clothes, gets his piggy bank, and runs to the Krusty Krab and tries the crane over and over again until the next morning, but to no avail. Mr. Krabs then empties the machine and finds an enormous amount of Squidward's quarters, along with the deed to his house. SpongeBob tells Squidward that the secret to winning is to be the crane, and he wins a teddy bear and rubs it in everyone's face. He even viciously mocks a kid who just lost the game and the kid gives Squidward a well-deserved kick in the shin before storming out while Squidward hops up and down holding his shin in pain.\nAt the end of the day, Squidward walks home with SpongeBob and sees a construction site. He operates the unoccupied crane with his eyes closed, thinking he can control it, and picks up a girder, but he cannot apply the same secret with that type of crane, resulting in the destruction of a mall the workers recently built. When Squidward realizes the destruction he had caused, he once again tries to \"be the crane.\" As a result, he accidentally hits the workers with the girder, sends the machine into reverse, and the crane spins around while doing so. SpongeBob and the workers run from the crane. It ends up stopping after destroying the Krusty Krab. Squidward tries to get away, but soon finds himself surrounded by the angry construction workers.

SpongeBob believes that Squidward is grouchy because he has not gotten his Sunday paper, and tries to give it to him. He bumps into Patrick, who is startled by the \"newspaper monster.\" Upon hearing of the monster, SpongeBob and Patrick start to panic and scatter the paper into the air as they run around, causing Squidward to yell angrily again, not knowing they're messing with the papers.\nSquidward begins his Sunday relaxation when SpongeBob and Patrick suddenly appear behind him wearing cultist-style fezzes and initiate him as president of the Secret Royal Order of the Good Neighbor Lodge, which SpongeBob and Patrick have just made up. As his first decree, Squidward tells SpongeBob and Patrick to paint all of the tree leaves around town with polka dots in an attempt to get rid of them both.\nOutside, SpongeBob absorbs a can of red paint; Patrick pulls his arm like a lever, causing him to shoot specks of paint onto all the trees. At noon, SpongeBob and Patrick return to Squidward to tell him that they are almost done with their task, and SpongeBob accidentally shoots paint on Squidward's face and in his eyes. Squidward runs outside, screaming in pain, and is almost hit by a car that Debbie Rechid and Ralph turn out to be driving. They think Squidward is sick with chickenpox and take him to the hospital, ignoring his protests. SpongeBob and Patrick share one last goodbye with Squidward.\nLater, SpongeBob and Patrick hold a club meeting and notice that Squidward is gone. They go inside his house to look for him when a foot massager arrives to give Squidward a pedicure, and the two are suspicious. When Squidward comes home, he finds SpongeBob and Patrick getting a pedicure to make sure that he \"really is a certified foot masseur and not some sort of assassin.\" Squidward furiously pushes them aside and angrily demands the man to massage his feet, but he tells him that his hour is over and leaves. This is the final blow to Squidward as he angrily forces SpongeBob and Patrick to leave, telling them never to bother him again.\nUnable to understand that Squidward hates them, SpongeBob asks Patrick if Squidward was trying to tell them something. Upon hearing this, an enraged Squidward literally smashes his head through the front door as he screams at the top of his lungs at them, making it crystal clear to them that they are the worst neighbors in history as he demands that they stop calling him president before taking their fezzes and furiously stomping them onto the ground. Upon realizing they weren't good neighbors to Squidward after all and they only ruined everything, SpongeBob and Patrick feel deeply hurt by this and sadly walk away.\nInside his house, Squidward laments to himself that there are only three hours of his Sunday left, a Sunday that SpongeBob and Patrick had taken away, as Squidward anguishes over not even being able to read his Sunday paper. Squidward sees his Sunday paper in a messy pile on the floor with a note from SpongeBob presenting it to him. Despite his neighbor's generosity, Squidward becomes furious again. He kicks the paper and growls like a dog until he sees an ad in the newspaper for a high-tech security system. Squidward does an evil laugh.\nSquidward receives the security system and installs it into his house. He believes that the security system will stop SpongeBob and Patrick from entering his house, but they suddenly come up behind him with an apology cake and their fezzes back on. But Squidward, understandably still angry at them for ruining his Sunday, refuses to accept their apology and thinks they are blatantly lying and that it is a trap, unaware they really mean it, demands the security system to destroy them, but the machine says, \"No threat detected.\" Squidward then punches the machine in frustration, and the machine says, \"Threat detected.\" The machine zaps Squidward, and startles SpongeBob causing him to drop the apology cake on top of the machine; it then begins malfunctioning and declares a \"code red\" situation, literally kicking Squidward out of the building. The house then grows arms and legs and walks away with SpongeBob and Patrick still inside. Squidward then realizes that they can now no longer bother him and as such, he reassures himself that he's going to relax—even if it kills him.\nMeanwhile, Squidward's house rampages through downtown Bikini Bottom, and SpongeBob and Patrick turn the security system off just as the house returns to its original position, causing it to fall on top of Squidward. Squidward's Sunday relaxation time is over, and he calmly tells them that he only wanted to enjoy his day off, and he has SpongeBob and Patrick leave so that he can get ready for work the next day. SpongeBob tries once again to apologize for earlier, but Squidward ignores him and shoos them out. However, he finds an angry mob outside of his house, and a man gives him a jury summons sentencing Squidward to court-ordered community service every Sunday for the rest of his life to pay off for the damages to the city.

Fearful, Squidward continues his work with a forced smile. Mr. Krabs gets a job at the Krabby O'Monday's working as a busboy, listening to SpongeBob complain about the problems.

The next day at work, after SpongeBob told the \"nickel joke\" to the customers, Squidward has decided he has had enough of SpongeBob's incessant laughter. He then sees SpongeBob hurting himself when he laughs, so he tricks him into believing that SpongeBob has a laugh-related illness. According to the made-up disease, if SpongeBob laughs one more time in the next 24 hours, his laugh box will explode, and he will never be able to laugh or giggle again.\nFor the rest of the day, SpongeBob fights every single urge to chuckle.

Mr. Krabs says that money always makes him laugh, but SpongeBob doesn't feel a tickle. Next, SpongeBob consults Sandy. Sandy gives SpongeBob books about laughter. SpongeBob reads the books, but still doesn't have any effect on his laugh box. Now utterly grief-stricken, all SpongeBob can do is bawl his eyes out, meaning more noise than ever. Feeling guilty, but still wanting peace and quiet, Squidward finally confesses to the sad SpongeBob that he lied to him just so he could get SpongeBob to stop his obnoxious laughing and have some peace and quiet for a while, as his weeping has been more annoying than his giggles, and after Squidward admits everything, SpongeBob laughs to see it has been a good joke and Squidward joins in the laughter. When Squidward says, \"You even fell for the thermometer in the boiling oil routine!\" SpongeBob immediately stops laughing, saying it's not really funny and goes inside his house. When Squidward laughs too much, he collapses and is taken to the hospital.\nAt the hospital, it is revealed that the laugh box actually does exist and Squidward just broke his. Purple Doctorfish points out that one of the others has given him half of their laugh box. It isn't Patrick, Mr. Krabs, or Sandy; it was SpongeBob, who shows the bandage to prove it. Shocked, Squidward starts to laugh like SpongeBob, to his great horror. He and SpongeBob laugh together before Squidward runs out of the building still laughing like SpongeBob in maniac state.

The bus arrives, and Patrick is about to climb aboard when SpongeBob grabs hold of him, begging his friend not to go while pleading earnestly for Patrick's forgiveness. The bus driver demands to know what the hold-up is, and when he sees that it is SpongeBob and Patrick, he gives SpongeBob Ol' Reliable, saying he left the net on the bus. SpongeBob is surprised at this, the bus driver adding he does it every week.\nTo make up for his accusations against Patrick, SpongeBob gives Ol' Reliable to his friend. Patrick is utterly overwhelmed by this gesture, and immediately decides to forgive SpongeBob for his thoughtlessness, and stay in Bikini Bottom after all. Everyone on the bus cheers, much to the chagrin of the bus driver, who claims that the two do this kind of thing all the time. SpongeBob and Patrick then run off to Jellyfish Fields together to enjoy their new nets during the last days of the jellyfish migration while the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Squid Wood", "completion": "As the episode begins, SpongeBob repeatedly annoys Squidward by asking him if he wants to play, but every time Squidward refuses, SpongeBob thinks he wants to play later. After SpongeBob asks Squidward to play a numerous number of games with him, Squidward loses his temper and yells at SpongeBob that he will never play with him ever. After throwing him down a hole and covering it with his fridge, SpongeBob then gets an idea that if he cannot play with Squidward, he will make one of his own.\nHe runs to his house and creates a wooden, mini version of Squidward, and calls him \"Mini Squid.\" After hearing that Mini Squid will be playing with SpongeBob if Squidward does not want to, Squidward becomes incredibly enlightened. While SpongeBob and Mini Squid play charades, Patrick walks by and thinks that Mini Squid is Squidward and also thinks he has gotten smaller and shaved his beard, even though Squidward does not have a beard, confusing SpongeBob and Mini Squid.\nAt the Krusty Krab, Squidward tells a joke to two customers, but they do not laugh because of his mood while telling the joke. As SpongeBob and Mini Squid come in, the two customers start to favor him. Squidward takes a customer's order, but he doesn't like his attitude. Mini Squid takes Squidward's job as cashier and takes the customer's order, and the customer likes his attitude. SpongeBob cooks the patties and Mini Squid delivers them to the customers. He tells Squidward's joke to the customers, and they laugh because of his happy mood while telling the joke. Squidward starts to get mad at Mini Squid for stealing his joke. A lady wants to give Mini Squid a $300 tip. Squidward takes his hat and his job back, but Mr. Krabs tells him that he prefers Mini Squid because he is making him plenty of money and changes Squidward's job to dishwasher.\nSoon, Mini Squid starts impressing the customers with some dance moves. Squidward realizes that they are his moves and starts to dance, but the customers are not impressed since Mini Squid is dancing for their pleasure and having fun doing it while the real Squidward is both being a bad sport and trying to hog the spotlight. Mini Squid and the customers soon start dancing like jellyfish. Finally reaching his breaking point, Squidward rages at Mini Squid for stealing his life and starts squeezing him, bashing him, stomping him, and mauling him.\nSuddenly, a man tells Squidward to stop mauling the head of his \"new client.\" Squidward realizes the man is a producer that represents his favorite clarinet player. Squidward thinks he was there to sign him up, but the producer takes Mini Squid. He is offering Mini Squid a $1,000,000 contract and a sequined suit. Squidward tries to impress him but fails, with the agent essentially telling him that he will never become famous. SpongeBob bids goodbye to his new friend.\nIn the end, Squidward starts to sob because Mini Squid stole his dream, but realizes he will never see him again. SpongeBob then picks up a wooden, mini-version of himself. The two start laughing after each other, much to Squidward's dismay."}
{"prompt": "Best Day Ever", "completion": "SpongeBob starts the episode by waking up and singing the song \"Best Day Ever,\" and he describes to Gary what he plans to do on this day: do his \"perfect\" job at the Krusty Krab, practice karate with Sandy, go jellyfishing with Patrick using his new high-tech net, and at the end of the day, attend Squidward's big clarinet recital. However, SpongeBob's \"Best Day Ever\" does not turn out as he plans. He goes to the Krusty Krab, only to find it condemned due to a severe nematode infestation. He then tells the nematodes to leave, but they eat his pants instead. SpongeBob begins playing the \"Best Day Ever\" song with his nose, causing the nematodes to follow him. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to keep playing and lead them as far away as possible, and he does so until they all fall asleep (including SpongeBob).\nHe then goes to Sandy's Treedome for karate, but Sandy is busy trying to fix a leak in the roof of her Treedome. SpongeBob thinks that this is a trap, and attacks her anyway. Sandy hits him and sends him flying up to the roof, and his glove sticks to it, sealing the leak. Afterwards, SpongeBob heads over to Jellyfish Fields to go jellyfishing with Patrick, but Patrick explains that he has broken his net. SpongeBob gives him his old net to use, but he quickly breaks it as well. Finally, SpongeBob gives Patrick his brand-new net and sits there watching as Patrick has fun jellyfishing with it.\nFinally, when SpongeBob goes to Squidward's clarinet recital, Squidward tells him that he cannot play in the concert because his clarinet reed is shot. SpongeBob pulls out one of his teeth to replace the reed, and angrily demands Squidward to put on the show, frustrated that the majority of his \"Best Day Ever\" is ruined. When SpongeBob tries to enter the concert, the doorman will not let him in because he does not have a ticket. He tries various methods of sneaking in, but is caught every time. Eventually, the doorman realizes who SpongeBob is (Mrs. Puff said his name while hiding in her purse), and lets him in because he is on the VIP list. However, the concert ends just as SpongeBob gets into his seat, and then he finally loses it.\nReaching his breaking point, SpongeBob goes up on stage, rips the curtains and starts angrily whining to the audience about how his \"Best Day Ever\" was completely destroyed. However, his friends go up and remind SpongeBob of how he helped them with their problems out of his kindness, and to make everything up to him, they hold a \"very expensive\" production in which SpongeBob performs his song, \"Best Day Ever,\" to complete his real Best Day Ever with his friends by his side. After hours, SpongeBob is still singing, his friends are tired and sleepy, the audience has left the concert hall, and the janitor is sweeping the floor. As the episode ends with Squidward asking, \"How long do we have to keep this up?\", Mr. Krabs replies with \"Just 'til his little heart gives out, Squidward. Just 'til his little heart gives out.\""}
{"prompt": "The Gift of Gum", "completion": "On \"Best Friends Day,\" Patrick gives SpongeBob an enormous wad of used gum he has amassed over his entire lifetime called \"Gummy\" to start of the episode, and SpongeBob finds it a better gift than the one he is giving Patrick: a robotic butler. However, when he takes it inside, he realizes how disgusting it is with its used and unwashed contents, and it even starts to scare him, with a pair of underpants crawling out of the gum and talking. First, SpongeBob tries to throw it away, but Patrick catches him in doing so, and he says that he was dressing it up with the garbage can.\nLater, SpongeBob tries to bury Gummy, but Patrick catches him again, and he says that he dug the hole to be able to look at Gummy from below. Patrick insists that it must be displayed properly, and places it above SpongeBob's doorway. SpongeBob next tries to dispose of it in the night, and in the process frees several fish who were trapped inside it. He tries to pull Gummy off of his house, and fails, destroying the ball and getting stuck to it in the process.\nThe next day, Sandy visits SpongeBob's house to see it covered in the sticky remains of Gummy, with SpongeBob hanging above his doorway. She tries to free him by lassoing a piece of Gummy onto a passing truck, which is almost able to pull it away, but is ultimately pulled in by it, hitting SpongeBob's house and causing the gum to explode, completely covering the houses of SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick, and trapping Squidward and Sandy as well. Patrick then appears, and SpongeBob tells him he can have Gummy back. Patrick then eats down all of the gum, making him super-morbidly obese, but also freeing SpongeBob, his friends, and their houses. Suddenly, Patrick hiccups a massive bubble, which explodes and covers all of Bikini Bottom with gum. Patrick ends the episode declaring that this is the best Best Friends Day ever."}
{"prompt": "Friend or Foe", "completion": "Patchy and Potty are working at a restaurant called \"The Poop Deck,\" hoping to be just like SpongeBob, although Potty claims he took the job for the \"free sodas.\" After receiving an order of scurvy fries and a diet bilge water from his boss Mr. Pirateson, Patchy shows off his new patty creations: \"Buried Treasure\" (a treasure chest in between two buns), \"Walk the Plank\" (a wooden board in between two buns), and finally the \"Patchy Patty\" (a lone burger patty with a face made up of an eye patch, pickle slice, and mustard). All of these ideas are shot down by Potty and, feeling that the latter is never supportive of him, Patchy ends their friendship and runs off. Patchy compares his situation to Mr. Krabs and Plankton, starting the SpongeBob plot.\nLater, Patchy starts to regret ending his friendship with Potty and starts to cry over a picture of the time the two first met. Potty then appears, and Patchy thinks he is there to apologize, but instead he is told to get back to work. Patchy begins to protest this, until he notices that Potty is wearing an assistant manager badge. Patchy questions this, and Potty says that his fancy book smarts got him the promotion. Patchy thinks this is unfair and insists that his cooking is great, but after witnessing a customer throw up a burger she ate into a doggy bag, Patchy realizes his food is terrible and Potty says that he needs a little practice.\nAfter a brief montage of training, Patchy makes his first burger. He tries it and almost immediately spits it out. He then declares \"For the crime of fouling me taste buds, I order you to walk the plank!\" (in other words, he throws it into the trash). Patchy shrugs and says that SpongeBob's first patty probably didn't go so well either. However, Potty proves him wrong by showing a clip of a baby SpongeBob making his first patty, and it's perfect on the first try.\nPotty then scolds Patchy for his unsanitary environment such as; keeping raw hamburger meat in an old boot (he claims this is what gives it its special flavor), having rats in the kitchen, not washing his hands after using the bathroom, and not wearing a hair net and apron. Fed up with Potty's criticisms, Patchy starts throwing patties at Potty, but each one misses, and one eventually hits Mr. Pirateson in the face. Patchy then tells the viewers to watch the rest of the episode while he watches Potty get fired.\nAfter the SpongeBob plot is over, Patchy is shown reading a newspaper with the word \"JOBS\" on the front and claims he decided to take some time off to catch up on his reading. Potty then says that Patchy actually got fired, and Patchy fires back saying that Potty got fired as well, which is true (but Potty also got a golden parachute). Patchy then says that the restaurant cannot replace him, but Potty says they already did. When Patchy notices that a gorilla has been hired as his replacement, Patchy calls it \"a smelly, hairy, fleabag\" and the episode ends as the gorilla responds to Patchy's insult by throwing patties and other food at him.\nAfter yet another attack on the Krusty Krab by Plankton, SpongeBob asks Mr. Krabs why they hate each other so much. Mr. Krabs tells his side of the story, in a series of flashbacks:\nMr. Krabs and Plankton were best friends from birth and did everything together. Both were outcasts, with Plankton being viewed as a nerd for his intelligence, and Mr. Krabs (ironically) being extremely poor, and victims of cold-hearted ridicule and social prejudice by a particular circle apparently led by Billy. One day, Mr. Krabs finds a penny at the carnival, his first exposure to money, which he spends on a balloon for Plankton. Later, they get enough money to buy a burger from Stinky's Burgers, which, despite having horrible food and literally being located in a dump, is very popular among the local children including Billy and his gang, due to being the only place in town to get a burger. Stinky, apparently just as shallow and mean as Billy and his group, refuses to serve them, saying that freaks like them are bad for business, and tells them to \"wait\" at the back of the building, only for him to yell at them again. There, they witness Stinky retiring for the day, having made millions from the stand. Plankton and Mr. Krabs decide to go into the burger business themselves and create their own burger so people will finally respect them and like them, but no one wants to try it. When Stinky is arrested and his establishment is closed by the local health department for numerous ethical and health code violations, the two open \"Plabs Burgers\" on his former site, which the children are now forced to eat at, despite it being even worse than Stinky's.\nPlankton says that they are now ruling the stomachs of the children, and soon will be ruling their brains. Mr. Krabs argues that it should be about satisfying the customers, rather than power. Soon, they get into an argument, and Mr. Krabs is ejected into a dump pile and tells Plankton that he will one day regret this.\nPlankton comes in and disagrees with Mr. Krabs' story and tells SpongeBob his own version. His story is the same as Mr. Krabs', except that their roles during the fight at the end are reversed, with Mr. Krabs wanting to rule the money of the children.\nPlankton and Mr. Krabs begin arguing about the story until Karen arrives and tells SpongeBob that both of them are lying to him and tells him the real story: as she had been a security camera installed by Plankton at the time and recorded everything.\nThe restaurant initially has no customers, and Old Man Jenkins is the first to try one of their burgers. Upon taking a bite, he smiles, falls to the ground, and a newspaper appears saying he knocked out by the taste of the burger. Mr. Krabs and Plankton become angry and accuse each other of tainting the patty. They begin fighting over the recipe, eventually tearing it in two, with Plankton getting the bottom half, which says \"...and a pinch of chum.\" Their friendship is over and Plankton storms out to pursue his own career in food. However, during the struggle, a shelf was knocked down, dumping various ingredients into the patty batter, creating the Krabby Patty recipe, which Krabs is left with. The two go their separate ways, each trying to open their own establishment. People really like Mr. Krabs' \"Krabby Patty,\" while Plankton's Chum Burger is horrible.\nAfter hearing the story, Plankton and Mr. Krabs begin to make up and apologize, until Plankton takes the formula from his pocket. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs start chasing Karen and Plankton in circles outside the Krusty Krab."}
{"prompt": "The Original Fry Cook", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, it is a normal day at the Krusty Krab, where Old Man Jenkins is making an order, until Jim, the original Krusty Krab fry cook, arrives in his golden limousine. Mr. Krabs and Squidward remember back when the Krusty Krab had \"class.\" Squidward had long hair and Jim was the fry cook. Jim makes a Krabby Patty and SpongeBob eats it and loves it. He wants to cook like Jim, and Jim says not to step on the patty since the customers run over a Krabby Patty made by SpongeBob when headed to greet Jim.\nJim then gives SpongeBob lessons on how to make his Krabby Patties better, but the latter cannot meet the former's standards, so SpongeBob decides to resign and give his job back to Jim. Jim tells SpongeBob he quit because he wanted to do bigger things with his fry cook career and also because Mr. Krabs laughed at him when he asked for a raise, thinking it was a big joke. Mr. Krabs reveals that SpongeBob has one thing Jim does not have: he is cheap (SpongeBob does not care of the raise). Jim tells SpongeBob he is a great fry cook and that he could be an even greater fry cook, but only if he leaves the Krusty Krab, which he calls a dump, to which SpongeBob says that it is not a dump. Mr. Krabs says that it is a dump, but that it is his dump, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Night Light", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob reads a scary book before bedtime. Because of this, he sees scary creatures when he turns off the light, such as the chair being a monstrous brain beast and a coral branch tapping the window as a monster's hand. After every time he turns on and off the light, he sees or hear something scary, and has continually done so during the night.\nWhen at the Krusty Krab, he gets terrified of a pot on his head, then tells Mr. Krabs that if he blinks, he sees something scary. He then tries not to blink, but it does not work. He then gets spooked by the dark in the freezer when Mr. Krabs wants him to get some fresh Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to get night lights so he will not be scared of the dark. He first buys one and however, buys more when he finds darkness in his house because he is easy to fool. Eventually, there are thousands of night lights in every room that he does not need.\nPatrick wakes up and sees SpongeBob's house lit up. He thinks SpongeBob is throwing a party and goes to his house, but SpongeBob warns him about the dark, so he brings his rock inside SpongeBob's pineapple. While doing a sleepover, Squidward's eyes get burned from the night lights. Squidward goes to SpongeBob's house and tells them that they have too many lights and that the creepy creatures of the dark are just their imagination. However, SpongeBob and Patrick continue to bring more lights, bringing even a lighthouse. The lighthouse makes a giant \"M\" in the sky, so Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy come. Meanwhile, the Moth, one of Mermaid Man's enemies who he has been searching 57 years for, finds the light, but SpongeBob traps him inside the lighthouse. The Moth then carries the lighthouse along with the pineapple.\nIn the end, SpongeBob and Patrick are alone in the dark until the sun rises. Patrick goes up to get it, thinking it is a light and SpongeBob falls asleep. Patrick comes down again on fire, shouting \"Too much light!\""}
{"prompt": "Rise and Shine", "completion": "SpongeBob wakes up one morning, stops his alarm clock, and looks out the window. He asks Gary about ever wondering what Patrick does every morning. The scene pans to Patrick sleeping on a chair in his house. His alarm clock rings and he becomes startled. He hides and realizes that it is something that happens every day. Then, the alarm clock continues ringing and Patrick says that the joke is over. Its persistent ringing angers Patrick, leading him to attack the lamp and rip it in half.\nHe then draws SpongeBob's face on his pillow and places his underwear on it to represent his best friend, SpongeBob. He asks PillowBob about the noise and then the pillow falls on the alarm clock.\nThen, it is time for breakfast. He goes to the refrigerator and many Canned Coral cans come out of it. Patrick thinks that he has nothing to eat, but he figures out that the food is in the can, so he takes a plate and asks the can to give him some food, but, being insentient, the can obviously does not respond. Patrick tries to open it and gets frustrated, so he throws it and it lands on the alarm clock, causing the food to come out of it.\nPatrick grabs the food and sits down to watch television. He eats the coral, but the ringing alarm clock comes again and he realizes that he is late. He runs downstairs, but trips on the broken lamp and falls down the stairs. He crashes through his dresser and his shorts are put on.\nThen, he falls again and he goes through his bathroom and grabs his toothbrush. Then, after some shenanigans, Patrick pops out of his rock and SpongeBob asks about his morning. Patrick says he just had another normal morning, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Waiting", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob and Gary are shopping at Barg'N-Mart, and SpongeBob sees a Kelpo cereal box that says there is a \"free prize inside.\" SpongeBob then rushes home and eats the cereal, but sees that there is no toy inside the box. SpongeBob looks at the cereal box more closely and sees that it actually says, \"free prize offer inside\" (the word \"offer\" is printed in the very small text between \"prize\" and \"inside\") and that he must send in 99 box tops in order to get the prize. SpongeBob goes and buys even more boxes of cereal, and he begins going through it very quickly without even taking off the box tops first. When SpongeBob puts more cereal in Gary's food bowl, Gary suggests he send in the box tops before eating all the cereal. SpongeBob then puts all the box tops into an envelope and sends it.\nNow, SpongeBob must wait patiently for the toy to arrive. Patrick also comes nearby and waits with him. Patrick asks what they are waiting for, and SpongeBob explains that he is getting a free toy. The mailfish comes by and gives SpongeBob three envelopes, but no toy. SpongeBob and Patrick must wait even longer now, much to their disappointment, and soon become hungry. Patrick suggests that he and SpongeBob go to the Krusty Krab for a Krabby Patty, but SpongeBob is afraid of the mailman coming with the toy while he is gone. So Patrick instead goes to the Krusty Krab by himself.\nSometime later, Sandy walks by and starts to ask SpongeBob if he wants to do karate with her, but SpongeBob grabs Sandy by the arm and easily slams her into the ground before telling her in a very rude tone that he is busy, and she leaves upset. After that, Gary shows SpongeBob his bowl because he is hungry, causing his owner to angrily shout his frustration that no one understands that he is busy waiting for the mailman, causing a scared Gary to go away.\nAfter calming down, Patrick comes back and SpongeBob lashes out at him for no reason. Patrick tells SpongeBob he missed his surprise birthday party at the Krusty Krab, so he had to bring back a present and some cake for him, making SpongeBob upset again. While trying to find the fork, Patrick accidentally eats SpongeBob's piece of cake, and the present, which SpongeBob is visibly excited about, turns out to be the fork that Patrick was trying to find earlier, which is now useless.\nSpongeBob loses it and starts bawling about how he is wasting his whole life waiting for his toy, and how Patrick apparently hates him now because he is a \"big jerk.\" Patrick says he does not hate him, but SpongeBob does not listen. The mailman arrives and asks for SpongeBob's signature. It takes a while after SpongeBob signs before he realizes that his toy has finally arrived! He and Patrick become so happy that they do a jig before falling over and dancing on the ground. Upon opening it, they call the toy beautiful before Patrick pushes the button on the toy and springs come out.\nSpongeBob thinks Patrick \"ruined\" the toy and is furious with Patrick tries to fix it, but makes it worse. Squidward comes home to see them rolling around crying. He tries to play his clarinet, but cannot because of all the noise. He asks what is wrong with them.\nSpongeBob explains to Squidward how he sent in box tops, waited for the mailman, and then how Patrick broke the toy. Squidward snatches the toy, \"fixes\" it, then shows him that the toy's head, arms, and legs are supposed to spring off, and reattaches them. SpongeBob and Patrick then hug Squidward, asking if there is anything they could do for him, and Squidward replies that they should move to another neighborhood, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Fungus Among Us", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob is asleep, and Gary has no food, so he wakes SpongeBob up. SpongeBob attempts to feed Gary some organic snail food, which he instantly gags at. Instead, Gary would rather eat some contagious sea fungus on the floor, much to the dismay of SpongeBob. As he tries to clean the ick off the floor, Patrick arrives at the Pineapple, where he points out the fungus stuck to SpongeBob's head. Patrick then gives SpongeBob the terrible advice of scratching his head \"like there's no tomorrow.\" After that plan fails, SpongeBob tries to clean it off his head. He also tries not to scratch it because it is itchy, but it only further spreads across his head.\nAt the Krusty Krab, he flicks off some contagious sea fungus on his nose, but it grows on the wall and grows back and bigger on him. He tries scraping it off his arm into the trash, but the same thing happens. Squidward sees SpongeBob in his state and calls the SWAT team. It is claimed that SpongeBob has the most severe case of ick yet. When the team is carrying SpongeBob away in a cage, some contagious sea fungus flies off of him and lands on Squidward's head. After Squidward itches it, when giving a Krabby Patty to Old Man Walker, it gets onto him. Meanwhile, the SWAT team has SpongeBob quarantined in his house with a bubble around him with the contagious sea fungus having taken a turn for the worse.\nPatrick comes in and does idiotic things that could pop SpongeBob's bubble before SpongeBob has him stop. The two then partake in a game of \"Pirate Wrestling,\" which ends with Patrick destroying the bubble, which SpongeBob points out to him. Afterward, Patrick blows another bubble around SpongeBob. Back at the Krusty Krab, the contagious sea fungus is spreading like wildfire. Squidward unknowingly spreads it all over the food Mr. Krabs is cooking, and the customers get infected. After Squidward sees he is infected, he announces this to where a mob forms to attack him. Mr. Krabs (who is infected too) stops it and defends his restaurant to a health inspector, who snaps at Mr. Krabs for thinking everyone was healthy.\nHowever, SpongeBob arrives in his bubble, having taken another turn for the worse. The health inspector points this out and instigates everyone to riot as Mr. Krabs blames Squidward who shifts it to SpongeBob since he technically started it. Everyone prepares to attack SpongeBob for spreading the contagious sea fungus as SpongeBob cries icky tears in his bubble.\nFrom outside, Gary sees everything. SpongeBob notices everyone attacking is spreading the ick and warns them, but it is too late and the ick gets on everybody in the Krusty Krab when the bubble pops, releasing a huge amount of fungus, covering many areas of the Krusty Krab.\nGary then arrives and starts licking the contagious sea fungus off of Mr. Krabs, as SpongeBob scolds him until Mr. Krabs explains to SpongeBob that Gary is supposed to eat the fungus since he is a bottom feeder and that is their job. Indeed, Gary has cured Mr. Krabs and quickly eats the fungus off Squidward, curing him too. Seeing this, the customers all beg for Gary to help them as well until Mr. Krabs comes up with an easy solution. The episode ends with Gary \"de-icking\" the Bikini Bottomites, by simply eating all the ick off their bodies, for $5.00 to Mr. Krabs' profit, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Spy Buddies", "completion": "The episode begins with a shadowy figure that looks like Plankton opening the safe that has the Krabby Patty formula inside of it. SpongeBob turns the light switch on, and it reveals it was just Mr. Krabs checking to make sure that the secret recipe is still safe and that Plankton did not try to steal it yet. He has not tried to steal it in a month, which, according to Mr. Krabs, means that he must be planning something big. Squidward then enters the office. When Mr. Krabs says that one of his employees will have extra work, Squidward leaves, leaving SpongeBob to work as a spy to follow Plankton in order to see what he is up to. After a parody of the opening sequence of several James Bond films, Patrick enters. After Patrick screams that he also wants to be a spy, Mr. Krabs gives them a Krabby Patty through which he (via a prerecorded message) tells them that their assignment is to follow Plankton to see what his plans are. If they fail to get the gadgets, and do not accept the task, they will be fired.\nSpongeBob and Patrick visit Sandy's Treedome to ask her about spying, and Sandy shows them spy inventions. SpongeBob is excited to use the equipment, but Sandy refuses to let them use any of them, as she feels they will just mess it up. As SpongeBob wonders what they would do now, Patrick promptly uses the knockout gun to knock Sandy out and they steal the equipment from her. One of the gadgets that they steal is the laser-equipped Bermuda shorts. Patrick replaces his normal pants with these. He wires the pants to his butt, so that it will fire lasers whenever he farts.\nThey start following Plankton, and it is revealed that Plankton buys baby clothes and has to buy stamps for mail. They tell Mr. Krabs everything through walkie-talkies and Mr. Krabs writes these down on a chalkboard. After loudly following Plankton (who tells them to quiet down), SpongeBob and Patrick set him on fire with a magnifying glass. When Plankton runs off, they pursue him with a jetpack (which alights Plankton again after he cools himself down in a soda cup). They fly past him, but then jump into a boat outfitted with spy equipment. Almost instantly, Patrick hits the self-destruct option. Afterwards, Mr. Krabs calls them through Patrick's \"pants-a-phone,\" reminding them to stay on task.\nLater that night, SpongeBob and Patrick are on the rooftop of the Chum Bucket, trying to get inside. Patrick has the idea to use the laser pants to make a hole for them, so he farts so hard that he cuts into the roof with the lasers. Plankton thinks that they came in late at night to eat his food while Mr. Krabs was not around. Patrick tells SpongeBob that he really has to go to the bathroom and he cannot hold it in. Patrick also says that his laser pants are not working correctly. Without his control, Patrick farts, causing the table behind him to disintegrate. As he keeps on trying to hold it in, Patrick's butt begins to shake because of the gas inside him. \nPlankton tries to offer a raspberry iced tea, a bran muffin, and even a prune Danish to Patrick, unaware that he has to use the toilet. Patrick tells SpongeBob that he really has to go. When the gas pressure becomes too much for him, Patrick begins to fart uncontrollably. As SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton scream, the lasers shoot out of the laser pants, making holes in the walls and destroying the Chum Bucket.\nAngry, Plankton sends a giant blimp to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs thinks the night had come early, but Squidward points to Plankton's blimp. When Mr. Krabs tells everyone to get into their positions, Squidward runs into the men's bathroom. Plankton pushes a button that starts playing annoying music that makes the customers leave. Mr. Krabs mentions that if he wants his customers, he can have them. He sucks them into a giant cannon and shoots at the blimp using the customers and Squidward. \nUnluckily, the attempt fails, as the customers bounce off the blimp. SpongeBob tells Patrick that it is all up to them to save the Krusty Krab, but Patrick jumps off the blimp and accidentally lands in the cannon, which fires him right at the blimp, causing it to burst. The Krusty Krab blows up as well.\nPlankton, now with the secret formula in hand, laughs and states \"I WIN! I ALWAYS WIN!,\" but SpongeBob reminds him that he always loses. Plankton corrects SpongeBob that he always wins and reveals that it is Mr. Krabs in disguise. The other Mr. Krabs is revealed to be actually a robot controlled by Plankton. Mr. Krabs and Plankton made a bet that if Mr. Krabs disguised himself as Plankton so he could steal the Krabby Patty formula better than him and if the Chum Bucket gets destroyed, Plankton would pay him a dollar. \nAfter Plankton gives money as part of the bet, Patrick yells at them to stop and rips his skin off revealing that he is Squidward. SpongeBob wonders if the Squidward standing next to him is actually Squidward, then rips his face off as the latter protests. Squidward angrily takes his ripped face back from SpongeBob and walks off. The characters then continue to take off their disguises. After both of them return to their real selves, SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that he is still confused that there are two Patricks, who both start laughing, as the episode ends."}

As the episode begins, Mrs. Puff first introduces herself and discusses the good and bad drivers (Squidward is the one with the Boat Smarts, and SpongeBob is the one without it).\nA driver with boat smarts fills their tire up to the appropriate level, but a driver without boat smarts pays no attention to how much air they are using. Squidward fills it up to the exact measurement, while SpongeBob pumps it up too much, making the boat tip over, crushing half of Squidward's boat and having the wheel pop right in front of his face.\nThe next section is about buckling up. This shows Squidward in a boat mobile with his seatbelt in the proper manner. He then starts driving until he sees a Bikini Bottom Traffic light and he stops. Once Squidward stops, we see SpongeBob crazily speeding around a corner with no regard for safety and probably with no seatbelt on. He hits Squidward, and when he is unable to remove his seatbelt, goes flying into a spiked steamroller and gets severely hurt.\nIn the next scene, it shows Squidward adjusting his mirrors before he begins to start the boat. Squidward starts the boat and begins to drive. SpongeBob adjusts his mirror dangerously while turning the steering wheel with one leg. He hits many fish, although he does not know because he is focusing on the mirror. He then swerves right in front of Squidward. SpongeBob adjusts the other mirror and hits Squidward with a beam of light and he is almost blinded until he puts on sunglasses. But Squidward did not see a wall and crashes into it. It shows a crash dummy, although instead of the head it shows Squidward's.\nMrs. Puff is in Squidward's boat talking about not drinking or eating while driving. Squidward is driving well, as usual. Mrs. Puff explains how Squidward's eyes are locked firmly on the road. SpongeBob is then shown swerving while eating a Krabby Patty and reading a magazine. When some fish are behind him, he turns around and says: \"Hi there!\" causing them to crash. Eventually, there is a huge stockpile of cars and the owners are furious. SpongeBob still speeds past, runs over a puddle and slides around saying: \"Wheeeeeee!\" SpongeBob then says hi to Mrs. Puff and Squidward when SpongeBob's boat slips on a mini pebble, strangely making his boat act as a ramp in which Squidward's boat travel over. They fly into the big stockpile of all the cars and it makes a huge crash. Mrs. Puff blows up very fast and SpongeBob drives past saying: \"Looks like you guys forgot your Boat Smarts!,\" he smiles and drives off, and Mrs. Puff and Squidward are not amused, making dust and the low-quality videotape recorder stops with Mrs. Puff saying: \"Never mind,\" as the episode abruptly ends."}
{"prompt": "Good Ol' Whatshisname", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, Mr. Krabs puts SpongeBob against Squidward in a work contest, telling them there will be a prize. He shows them a brochure for a cruise vacation, which Squidward desperately wants to win. The contest is to name all the customers in the Krusty Krab. Somehow, SpongeBob knows everyone's name, and Squidward is confused by this, so he asks SpongeBob why this is so. SpongeBob then reveals he has a book with everybody's name in it. Squidward then swipes the book and says the names in the book.\nHe told Mr. Krabs that he has more points than SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs admits that he didn't tally the scores, so he claims that they both were neck and neck to the winner and that whoever gets the last customer's name is the winner. After a struggle of trying to remember, Squidward then pushes SpongeBob out of the way and asks the fish his name. However, the man appears to simply respond \"What's it to ya?\"\nAfter three attempts to find out his name, Squidward snatches his wallet and runs. He attracts a cop, who chases him because he ran a stop sign, and more so after he realizes he stole a wallet too. Squidward then makes it on top of the roof and after a tug-of-war for the wallet, Squidward manages to get his driver's license, which reads \"Mr. What Zit Tooya.\" He is then arrested and imprisoned for 10 years.\nMr. Krabs and SpongeBob visit Squidward in jail to give him his \"prize,\" which is revealed to be the brochure itself, not an actual vacation. After maniacally tearing the brochure, Squidward is relieved that he gets peace and quiet for the next ten years until he sees Patrick is his cellmate. He offers to play Parcheesi with Squidward, prompting Squidward to literally fall apart in depression, as the episode ends."}

After speedily running around, it does not tire him. He drinks a glass of warm snail milk, which causes him to fall asleep within moments.\nThe next morning, SpongeBob wakes up and finds out he overslept. He desperately rushes to get to the Krusty Krab (Additionally forgetting his left shoe behind), even jumping over an unfinished bridge that is over a cliff to get there on time. Right when he puts his employee time card in the slot, the clock changes to 9:01 AM, making him one minute late. Worried that Mr. Krabs will punish him for being one minute late, SpongeBob begins working in overdrive to try and make up for his lost minute. Soon, Mr. Krabs notices his jumpiness and checks on him, but SpongeBob breaks down, telling Mr. Krabs that he was tardy, and he begs Mr. Krabs to not throw him out. Mr. Krabs does not scold him that much (even saying \"Um... don't do it again.\"), but at SpongeBob's request, Mr. Krabs makes him clean the salad bar. Squidward sarcastically suggests to SpongeBob that he should live at the Krusty Krab if he loves it so much. That night, SpongeBob brings his bed to the Krusty Krab and sleeps there.\nThe next morning, Mr. Krabs is shockingly startled by SpongeBob's bed. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that he is going to live at the Krusty Krab from then on. When Squidward finds out, he is overjoyed. That night, SpongeBob brings all of his furniture to the Krusty Krab to make himself feel more at home.\nThe next morning, Squidward is thrilled that SpongeBob no longer lives next door to him. He happily tells the news to a customer. Later, when the customer asks Squidward for change, he gives him two socks and a pair of underwear. Squidward then notices the whole cash register is filled with socks and underwear. He asks SpongeBob why they are in there and where the money is. SpongeBob then says that the money is now being kept in a pickle jar. More socks and underwear are hanging up on a clothesline. A customer then takes a pair of underwear, thinking it is a napkin. SpongeBob then explains to Squidward that Gary has the mustard.\nLater, SpongeBob moves his furniture into Mr. Krabs' office. Then, SpongeBob's parents come to the Krusty Krab. Gary's trail of slime gets all over the floor and customers keep slipping on it and injuring themselves. Luckily, Gary is carrying a \"wet floor\" sign. A customer then tells SpongeBob about the \"snail trail\" incident, and SpongeBob becomes mad at Gary.\nSoon after, SpongeBob wreaks havoc at the Krusty Krab after living there a few more days. He ends up placing soap decorations in the bathroom, knitting napkin holders, and embroidering the menus. Mr. Krabs becomes angry when he notices shower curtains in his office. He threatens to tear them down, but when he does, he finds Margaret SquarePants taking a shower. Harold SquarePants comes in and angrily beats up Mr. Krabs before fleeing crazily. The customers leave the Krusty Krab in disgust when they find out SpongeBob is shaving Patrick's back hair and Mr. Krabs cries for his loss of customers. Having enough of SpongeBob's antics, a furious Mr. Krabs forces SpongeBob to move out of the Krusty Krab.\nSpongeBob moves back to his house and plays his very loud drums, much to Squidward's dismay, who cries in agony. The next morning, Mr. Krabs returns to the Krusty Krab, only to discover that now all of Squidward's stuff is inside, much to his chagrin."}

Mr. Krabs' frugality has prevented him from adjusting the Krusty Krab's thermostat to any temperature besides 62 °F. When Squidward tries to turn up the heat just one degree, an alarm goes off and Mr. Krabs berates him, allowing Plankton to get an idea to freeze his competition out of business. Having hidden in an old man's drink, Plankton is swallowed alive, and has to wait until the old man accidentally stays in the bathroom long enough to be locked into the restaurant overnight. Then Plankton lets a faucet run, opens a freezer, and turns the thermostat to sub-freezing temperatures\nThe next morning, Squidward complains even more than he already was, but Mr. Krabs does not allow him to turn up the thermostat because he is somehow fooled by the taped scrap of paper that says \"62 º\" that Plankton placed over the actual temperature display. Squidward notes that there are even icicles on the ceiling and the customers start to leave due to SpongeBob and Squidward slipping on the entirely ice-covered floor with their food. Plankton sees the customers leaving and rejoices. He then puts up a sign saying that the Chum Bucket is warm and speaks to a fish walking by, who is frightened by Plankton's eye looking through the huge telescope. Plankton is angry when he then sees the customers go back into the Krusty Krab with winter wear. Mr. Krabs has turned the restaurant into an ice rink complete with a Clamboni ride for children. SpongeBob has invented Patty skates to help him, Squidward, and the customers keep their balance. The customers even prefer cold Krabby Patties, making Mr. Krabs very happy to sell Krabby Patties without even needing to cook them, claiming that he has made even more money than with the old Krusty Krab.\nPlankton sees Mr. Krabs with his money and is furious. Karen advises Plankton to swipe a Krabby Patty and he attempts to steal one. However, SpongeBob and the local hockey team (who were actually trying to take the puck SpongeBob took by mistake) block the door after Plankton tries to run them over after hijacking the Clamboni, but he squashes them between the door. Plankton then goes over to the thermostat and reveals the true temperature, infuriating Mr. Krabs, who finally realizes Squidward was right about the temperature and attempts to attack Plankton for his actions. However, Plankton begins freezing and boiling the patrons by repeatedly turning the dial in both directions. He then falls off the dial, allowing Mr. Krabs to freeze him. Later, in the following summertime, Mr. Krabs turns the whole Krusty Krab into a popular public swimming pool, relaxing on a floating chair, while he thanks Plankton (trapped in an ice cube) for his ideas, and sips lemonade with Plankton as the ice in the drink, resulting in Plankton screaming and ending the episode after that."}

SpongeBob wakes up shrieking that he does not want to go on the Fiery Fist O' Pain. But, the next day happens immediately after, and Patrick breaks into SpongeBob's bedroom strangely after having the same nightmare at the same time, but they decide not to tell each other. The bus then comes, and they go to Glove World!. They realize that it is a long line to the new ride, so they decide to start going on the ride for toddlers called \"The Mitten,\" which they are scared of, annoying the toddler who is on the ride with them. Just then, they see Larry, who went on the ride. SpongeBob says that he did not go on the ride because he was hungry along with Patrick.\nSoon, they eat ice cream. Patrick has to use the bathroom and argues with his reflection in the mirror, while SpongeBob and his ice cream get into an argument. Patrick and SpongeBob want to tell the truth to each other, but the announcer says that Glove World! will close in five minutes. Hearing that, they finally go on the Fiery Fist O' Pain, but as they are ready, the ride breaks and they finally admit to each other that they were actually afraid to go on, and they feel relieved.  Shortly after that, the ride gets fixed and they end up riding the rollercoaster. Even though they are scared the whole time, they are really happy that they survived after the ride ends.

As a result, he tricks SpongeBob and Patrick into fixing it up by whimpering an excuse for him not to remodel. Soon, he realizes that they both have done everything wrong and breaks down sobbing about his failure, which attracts their loyalty towards him to make the Chum Bucket a success.\nSoon after seeing their progress, Squidward criticizes them and tells them that they are not painting correctly. He joins in and paints different, unexpected art on the front of the restaurant. Plankton sees Squidward's joining the experiment, as an opportunity to purloin the Krabby Patty secret formula, but Plankton sees that Squidward's art is paintings of himself, causing him to repaint it into a log cabin. SpongeBob requests something to drink, but Plankton says that his pipes are not working and he can't get water even if he wanted to, they were rusted shut. This causes SpongeBob and Patrick to start replacing every part of the Chum Bucket with parts from the Krusty Krab.\nWhen Plankton slides into the safe after the others are still working, he finds out that Mr. Krabs is nowhere to be seen and has replaced the formula with a to-do list. An angry Plankton bursts out of the safe, he sees the Krusty Krab is gone and in the place of the Chum Bucket. Mr. Krabs then returns and it turns out that he was on vacation (on a safari maybe) and keeps the formula in another safe while away (inside him). He sees the rearranging of his business and literally pushes the Krusty Krab back to its normal spot. He picks Plankton up and is about to tell Plankton the usual stay away from his restaurant speech. However, an exasperated Plankton cuts him off by finishing the sentence for him, as Mr. Krabs is confused. Plankton states they've done this many times and he saves Mr. Krabs the trouble, with Plankton launching himself back to the Chum Bucket, which is completely gone. He tells a frustrated Karen not to nag him after the day he just had.\nAfter about 1 day, Mr. Krabs is enjoying the remodeled Krusty Krab, which was remodeled by Squidward, who used parts of the Chum Bucket, including the floors of the restaurant for the new wall areas, the walls of it for the central fountain, and Plankton's wife, Karen, like the computer.\nThe episode ends with a customer wanting to order a Krabby Patty for $25 until Mr. Krabs persuades him to get four of them for $100 because of the decorations."}

Patrick and Sandy arrive, both hoping to play with SpongeBob, only for him to ignore them in favor of spending the day with Patty. Patrick is especially dismayed to have been rejected by his best friend. Meanwhile, SpongeBob takes Patty to several activities while singing a song, such as going to the Valentine's Day Carnival, eating cotton candy, the mall, the beach, and when clams try to eat Patty, SpongeBob attacks them with karate. Later, they ride a boat down a river and go down a waterfall. Patty falls apart in the water, so SpongeBob puts the sandwich back together, but now Patty is soggy and gloomy looking. SpongeBob ends the song at this point.\nAfter six hours of activity, SpongeBob takes Patty on a picnic in the park, but by now, the patty has spoiled. Somewhat oblivious to this, SpongeBob decides to take it on a date to the Krusty Krab. Once there, SpongeBob informs Mr. Krabs about his date and Mr. Krabs gets excited, thinking he is dating a rich girl, but finds it strange when he discovers the date is a Krabby Patty, with a rancid smell that drives off other customers. Squidward sullenly tries to tell SpongeBob that his date is just a rotten Krabby Patty, but SpongeBob still thinks Patty is beautiful until he smells her, then sees the hideous appearance of the spoiled patty.\nSpongeBob questions how this came to be. Mr. Krabs tells the fry cook that he once fell in love with a Krabby Patty. He then tells SpongeBob that Krabby Patties are meant to be loved and eaten.

After Squidward finds out that they have snuck into his room every morning at approximately 3:47 to celebrate holidays like Easter, Valentine's Day, and the Fourth of July, it is told that his brain has a nasty storm raging whenever Squidward sees SpongeBob. His happy gland is forced to find shelter in his mind's recesses, but he gets the flu and has to stay in bed due to no recess deep enough, until the two leave.\nThree hours later, Squidward installs an electric fence around his house to prevent SpongeBob and Patrick from intruding. He tricks them into picnicking on a wooden catapult, which he uses to fling them outside the fence. To Squidward's surprise, the two land back inside and ask to be catapulted again, resulting in Squidward refusing and then ordering them out. As he opens the activated fence's door, he is electrocuted, clearing the storm over his brain. After SpongeBob unsuccessfully attempts to rouse Squidward and decides to go to the petting zoo with Patrick instead, Squidward awakens and asks if he could go with the two to see the seahorses and scallops, to which the surprised duo agree to.\nSquidward continues to express happiness and perform kind gestures for SpongeBob the next morning, such as waking SpongeBob up for work as his alarm clock, turning the pages on his newspaper, flossing his teeth for him and walking to work with him.\nAt the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is surprised to see Squidward enter the kitchen, saying that he wanted to help SpongeBob work. SpongeBob promptly rejects this and Squidward is called out front by Mr. Krabs. He asks Susie is she wants tartar sauce, gives her a free hat and then asks everybody if they want free refills. This shocks Mr. Krabs, who hates people giving other people grub and refills for free, and either calls cheap food and verbal abuse or back into the kitchen with SpongeBob he goes. Squidward returns to the kitchen, even making a fresh batch of Krabby Patties, but SpongeBob arrogantly rejects them, calling them \"no good\" and telling him being a fry cook takes \"years of practice\" and that he would \"never be up to it.\" He is stopped by Mr. Krabs when trying to throw them away, and is told they look fine to him despite SpongeBob's protest. SpongeBob becomes angry when he finds out Squidward has become a fry cook. Squidward expresses his desire to be Employee of the Month, with SpongeBob already being one a gazillion times, but the latter corrects him, saying a gazillion and six times and telling him to \"keep dreaming.\"\nMr. Krabs then barges in to show SpongeBob a patty with a smiley face and dimples made out of ketchup and ask him about it. SpongeBob says that Squidward made it, expecting Mr. Krabs to be upset at Squidward. However, Mr. Krabs loves the little ketchup dimples Squidward made so much and makes him the new Employee of the Month, much to SpongeBob's shock and horror. Patrick then arrives with a scrumptious chocolate cake with light blue and white frosting for the award winner, which SpongeBob reluctantly and sadly erases his name on the cake and replaces it with Squidward's.\nLater, a party is thrown at Patrick's house to celebrate Squidward being the Employee of the Month. SpongeBob becomes enraged after seeing Squidward pogo-dancing with Patrick and yells at him, hurting Squidward emotionally and kicking him out of the party, even calling him a \"bub.\" Squidward cries and sadly walks out of the rock and attempts to enter his house again, but is electrocuted again upon touching the doorknob.\nSpongeBob and Patrick come to Squidward to apologize for his behavior to Squidward, and SpongeBob slaps Squidward's hand wanting to meet him \"all the way\" and let bygones be bygones, leading to SpongeBob getting electrocuted.

He then says \"money talks.\" He likes the idea and wishes he could talk to money.\nLater, at his house, Mr. Krabs forces the money to talk, but it doesn't. Mr. Krabs then shouts he wants to talk to money. The Flying Dutchman appears and says he would grant his wish if he sells his soul. Mr. Krabs takes the offer and the Flying Dutchman throws pixie dust on him.\nKrabs then wakes up and thinks it was a dream until he hears his money talk.

Mr. Krabs tries to put the rest of the money in a bag, give it to a visiting SpongeBob, who is worried about his health. Mr. Krabs quickly asks him to bury it, but realizes that just makes him lose the money, so he takes the bag back and SpongeBob takes it as a sign he is alright.\nLater on, Mr. Krabs becomes restless and starts to regret his deal with the Flying Dutchman, even demanding the deal be put off.

Squidward's desire to win coaxes him to be the coach for SpongeBob and Patrick. Squidward wanted to see SpongeBob and Patrick's dance moves, but Patrick ends up with a butt cramp after trying to pass the limbo stick. He ends up rolling around in pain, and Squidward lets him roll out the door. Squidward asks for SpongeBob's moves, but all he has is wiggling his arms, going around, and laughing. Squidward soon finds himself inside SpongeBob, which gives him an idea: Squidward gets inside of SpongeBob and controls the dancing.\nOn the night of the big competition, lots of people come, as well as a coin dancer who wows the crowd and ends with a high rating. SpongeBob thinks he cannot compete against that, but Squidward thinks different. When SpongeBob's up, Squidward dances, but the crowd is not enjoying it. Soon, Squidward gets a cramp in some of his tentacles, causing him to scream in pain and hold it whilst hopping around. Soon, the crowd leaves, and Fred is the last to leave. But after catching a glimpse of Squidward reacting to his cramp, he begins to call the crowd back. In pain from the cramp, Squidward has to pull up his knee, making SpongeBob question if this is part of the act. Soon enough, Squidward's remaining tentacles get cramped too, causing Squidward to pull that knee up too, and hold them in pain, causing SpongeBob with no arms or legs, to fall over. The crowd actually applauds at the end, which leads to SpongeBob and Squidward getting the trophy. SpongeBob pops out his arms and legs and begins to take the trophy, but Squidward beats him to it, causing him to have to swallow the trophy to get to Squidward. SpongeBob then says he could not have done it without Squidward, and pulls Squidward out of him, revealing that partnered dancers are disqualified (as the rule book states that a single dancer should not have any assistance from a partner). The trophy is confiscated from Squidward, and it turns out that literally everyone was partnered, even the coin dancer (he had someone named Pedro hidden in his hair, and he had something that popped out coins). The only individual dancer in the contest is number 52, which is indeed Patrick who also got a real cramp like Squidward did, winning him the trophy. SpongeBob says he is impressed with Patrick's new dance, whence Patrick screams before saying, \"Thanks.\"\nIn the epilogue, Incidental 49 comes into her son Tommy's room to find him doing the cramp dance, but Incidental 49 thought he was hurt.

Mr. Krabs discovers that SpongeBob has the \"1,000-yard stare\" before asking him what the problem is. They then discover a mini-calendar in his hat that has the current date circled, and it said \"Important food critic visits Krusty Krab.\" Squidward remarks only a moron would worry about that, in which both Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are both in shock. Squidward states his point was proven and leaves.\nSoon, Gene Scallop (the food critic) walks through the doors. As he is having his first glimpse of the restaurant, Squidward rudely talks to him, and nearly drives him away with other rude comments. Mr. Krabs stops him and SpongeBob serves him a Krabby Patty. Gene then takes a bite and leaves the restaurant, causing Mr. Krabs to lose hope.\nSpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward watch as Gene gives his review on the Krusty Krab, only to soil it. He says that the Krusty Krab smells \"like the rear end of a goat\" and that \"you could find livelier help in a graveyard.\" The customers hear the review and begin to leave in displeasure. However, an excited Gene says that the Krusty Krab is a big success because of the Krabby Patty he had and SpongeBob is no square when it comes to cooking, ending with a good review. The customers come back pleased and prepared to eat. With things okay, SpongeBob is relieved and goes to cook while Mr. Krabs gets a money-making idea.\nThe next day, SpongeBob goes to work and sees a new sign at the Krusty Krab, reading \"The Krusty Sponge.\" He also sees a long line and Squidward in a SpongeBob costume as the restaurant's mascot. SpongeBob is oblivious to the costume and compliments him on his shoes, but Squidward immediately scares him off with a hiss. Tyler the fish asks Squidward for his autograph, but Squidward says no because he has no use of his arms, and he accidentally slaps Tyler, disappointing Mr. Krabs, especially when he wouldn't pay for an autograph. Mr. Krabs then assigns Squidward to cook while SpongeBob finds out that his new job is to run a train outside the Krusty Krab, which Mr. Krabs charges customers to ride.\nMr. Krabs has Squidward cook and bathes in his money before Squidward tells him of a delivery man here to see him. It is shown he has continued to order more SpongeBob-related items such as drinking straws, coasters, bibs, ice cubes, and other things as Squidward questions if he is going too far. Mr. Krabs insists Squidward while showing clear signs of delusion, and later has Squidward (who has managed to cook) serve the new Spongy Patties, which are actually tainted Krabby Patties that look like SpongeBob since they couldn't fit in the fridge with the ice cubes. When Squidward questions him on serving rotten meat, Krabs at first seems to realize his point before he doubles the price for them.\nWhen SpongeBob is out of energy from driving the train, he stops pedaling, but his passengers do not care in the slightest at how obviously exhausted he is and believe that he is an impersonator of SpongeBob. They soon threaten to riot if not given a ride. Using this distraction, SpongeBob manages to slip away after putting his statue in his place. He enters the Krusty Krab and discovers Mr. Krabs had gotten all kinds of new products customized to look like SpongeBob.\nHe also discovers that the new Spongy Patties are making people sick by turning them yellow with green spots (resembling SpongeBob) and giving them terrible stomach pains. SpongeBob gets Mr. Krabs to come out and when he sees the customers, he thinks he is invaded by zombies who want to eat his money and tries to protect his fortune. However, SpongeBob stops him and explains they are actually his customers who ate the Spongy Patties. A customer eats his sick friend's patty and is disgusted. He confronts Mr. Krabs over it and the latter meekly explains it's a Spongy patty before the customer gets sick as well. A distraught SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that he has poisoned all of his customers with the rotten patties. Mr. Krabs is shocked and guilty as he realizes what he has done. Before he can fix his mistake, he is immediately arrested by the angry customer who is actually a cop.\nIn court, Mr. Krabs feels remorseful and guilty about his actions. The jury, headed by Gene Scallop, finds him guilty, and Mr. Krabs accepts the charges. Just as Mr. Krabs is about to go to prison, he realizes the Judge has a SpongeBob gavel, and he turns out to be a huge SpongeBob fan. Mr. Krabs makes a deal with the judge that SpongeBob goes back to cooking while Squidward has to ride the Judge around on the Krusty Sponge Fun Train for the rest of the day if Mr. Krabs does not want to go to prison.

I have to go to the bathroom.\" The gym teacher told him that he had told him repeatedly that it was gym class, so he had the class throw dodgeballs at him.\nNonetheless, he has a plan to write his song fast so it would be a masterpiece and he will not get hit by dodgeballs again. Patrick takes SpongeBob's comic book money to enter $100 and submits an entry called \"I Wrote This.\" The song does not make much sense and it is so awful that even the paper smells terrible when he submits it, and the band dies recording it. When the two listen to the song through a large loudspeaker, it turns out to be so bad that it melts down SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob, however, enforces to Patrick that it is the greatest song ever, so he and Patrick try to get the song on the radio.\nThey are immediately kicked out by the radio station, so, finding a different method, they climb up the radio tower and use a piece of chewed gum to stick the record player to the top of the antenna. The song is heard throughout the town, which causes rioting, literal head explosions, and a plane crash into a fireworks storage building. The town hates the song so much that they form an angry mob, which is headed by Fred. They yell about how much they hate the song and run SpongeBob and Patrick down to the ground.\nWhile it looks like they are getting beat up, it turns out that SpongeBob and Patrick are making random noises with musical instruments and a chainsaw. Patrick said that was his new song, which the mob admits that it is not that bad and it is better than the first one Patrick made. Patrick starts to sing the song in front of everyone until his old gym teacher arrives, saying that Patrick never learned his lesson, which leads to the two getting humiliated as the angry crowd pelts them with dodgeballs as punishment."}
{"prompt": "A Flea in Her Dome", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob and Patrick are crying, because Sandy has gone to Texas for two whole days. They decide to take the time until she comes home to prepare for and throw her a welcome home party. During their party, SpongeBob and Patrick notice that Sandy is scratching and biting her fur. Sandy explains that upon her return from a science convention in Texas, she unknowingly brought back a flea. Sandy asks SpongeBob to open her briefcase and take out the flea collar.\nThe flea jumps out of her fur and lands on SpongeBob. SpongeBob gets bitten and grabs the collar. The flea then lands on Patrick and bites him, causing Patrick to take the collar. They then fight over the collar, which causes Sandy to grab the collar and wrap it around all three of them. The flea then reproduces, causing the flea collar to be eaten away, rending it useless. Fleas take over Sandy's tree dome, and no one can escape the dome. Patrick blames Sandy for bringing the flea and getting infected, then SpongeBob blames for throwing the party, which causes SpongeBob and Patrick to fight. Sandy breaks up the fight and tells them that arguing is not going to help save themselves as long as they work together.\nPatrick comes up with the idea of creating a tower to the tree, only to climb up and get an apple. Sandy is annoyed at Patrick's stupidity and the group takes refuge in the tree. But it proves to be useless as the fleas continue to spread all over the treedome.\nSpongeBob states they may be living in a sea of fleas instead of salt water, thus giving Sandy an idea on how to get rid of the fleas. Sandy then crashes into the cauldron with fleas by infecting all their space in the dome with saltwater. This drowns and gets rid of the fleas, but all the Bikini Bottom citizens are stuck in the dome at the end. SpongeBob tells Sandy its good to have her back, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "The Donut of Shame", "completion": "The episode starts off with the morning after SpongeBob's tea party, Patrick wakes up and remembers the tea party. He says that he must have passed out in SpongeBob's kitchen on the ceiling. The screen zooms out and flips upside-down and Patrick falls back onto the floor. He remembers that the party lasted after 8:30 PM and says things get crazy then. (that was kind of proved when a flashback of the tea party they were both in at 8:35 PM that night) He looks around for SpongeBob and finds him in the living room with a donut in his hand. Since SpongeBob has also passed out, Patrick takes the donut.\nWhen he arrives home, he wants to eat it, but just before he does, he needs fine china for the donut. He reaches his cupboard and nearly all of his plates break. Patrick uses the one that didn't break. He was going to eat it, but then he remembers SpongeBob saying, \"This kind of donut can really make a guy happy...\" He then thinks he has stolen SpongeBob's donut. Two angel-and-devil donuts appear beside him. The angel donut tells him not to eat because SpongeBob is his friend, while the devil donut tells him not to trust the angel donut because he has sprinkles. Patrick doesn't know who to trust so the devil donut gives him an idea by attaching a chain to it and saying that he can pull it out when SpongeBob wants it back. The angel donut admits that it is actually quite a good idea, and the donuts disappear. Patrick tests out his method, but when he pulls the chain, the donut does not come out with it. Panicking, he quickly coughs it back up.\nHis phone then rings. It is SpongeBob on the other line, who says that he will be right over to Patrick's house with a tape of the night before. Patrick realizes that the tape will show him taking SpongeBob's donut, so he runs around his house, trying to hide it. He tries under a rug, but he thinks that SpongeBob might step on it. He hides it in the toaster, but he worries that SpongeBob will want to make toast. He thinks of hiding it in the toilet, but he thinks that SpongeBob might want to use it. He then tries his \"attic,\" but halfway up the stairs, he remembers he doesn't have one, and falls because there are no stairs either. He then forgets what just happened and tries the \"attic\" again, but simply falls once more.\nSpongeBob finally arrives, and Patrick quickly hides the donut in the back of his pants. SpongeBob presents the videotape and prepares to watch it. Thinking the jig is up, Patrick breaks down crying and admits to taking the donut, but SpongeBob defends him and states that it was okay for him to do so. He shows Patrick the tape that shows him giving the donut to him as a present. A confused Patrick realizes the donut is his as SpongeBob tells him that the party was for his birthday. Patrick then recalls his birthday party and pulls the donut, now expired, from his pants, splits it in half, and asks SpongeBob if he wants to share. As the episode ends, SpongeBob accepts as he eats the half donut, only to make him sick as Patrick says, \"Pretty good, huh?\"."}
{"prompt": "The Krusty Plate", "completion": "The episode starts with Mr. Krabs closing the Krusty Krab, stating \"Thought those deadbeats would never leave.\" Meanwhile, SpongeBob is in the kitchen and finishes washing the dishes. Mr. Krabs comes in and finds a dirty spot on a plate. He shows this to SpongeBob and states that he can't leave until he gets the spot removed. Mr. Krabs then tells SpongeBob to lock up when he's done. SpongeBob then reminds Mr. Krabs that the last time he was left alone at work, the Krusty Krab was set on fire. Mr. Krabs assures SpongeBob that he removed all welding equipment from the premises, so there is thus no chance of a fire happening again.\nAfterwards, SpongeBob tries scrubbing the spot off the plate, but that doesn't work, so he decides to declare war. First, SpongeBob uses a jackhammer, but then falls over and the jackhammer repeatedly smacks him in the face. Secondly, he tries repeatedly banging a bat on the plate, which fails. Thirdly, he uses a chainsaw and repeatedly bangs on the plate, which doesn't work either. Once SpongeBob is out of breath, he gets a tank and shoots a pink sponge on the plate. Since that fails, SpongeBob spits on it, and the spot still doesn't come off and instead slightly increases the size. After this, a determined SpongeBob states \"I got to finish this.\"\nSpongeBob soon comes back, dressed in an army outfit and introduces the dirty spot to the Spot-Master 6000. He first shows the spot the microwave-powered laser particle beam. Then, he shows it the laser-guided high-pressure water cannon. Finally, SpongeBob shows the spot a specially woven metal alloy ingeniously combined with state of the art cleaning materials. He calls it \"steel wool\" and it comes with a laser. SpongeBob asks the spot \"Any last words?\" After hearing nothing from the plate, SpongeBob starts up Spot-Master 6000 and turns on the particle beam and the water cannon. Since it's not working, he turns on the steel wool laser. While this is happening, the Krusty Krab shakes, lights are shining out of it, and Mr. Krabs can see it from his house while in bed. Mr. Krabs looks through his window, and he doesn't worry because he assumes it has nothing to do with SpongeBob.\nMeanwhile, SpongeBob is still trying to get the spot off and then crosses the laser beams. He declares \"More power!\" While this happens, the Krusty Krab sends out 'sound'-like waves through the air, causing everything to look like it's wiggling. Mr. Krabs checks out of his window again and decides to go see how SpongeBob is doing. When near the Krusty Krab, he finds unusual activity within the restaurant. As Mr. Krabs gets his key out, SpongeBob uses maximum power on the spot. Once Krabs opens the door, a huge blast wrecks the restaurant and a bursting size of an atomic bomb. Once the explosion is over, the restaurant is completely destroyed and then the Spot-Master 6000 disintegrates. SpongeBob looks at the plate and notices the spot finally came off. However, Mr. Krabs no longer cares about the plate since his restaurant is demolished, and angrily chases SpongeBob around the ruins, as the episode ends."}

As he is lamenting his failure on a bench in the park, Plankton then hears a woman saying that she can take her baby's milk away from him and he cannot do a thing about it. This makes Plankton realize he will turn Mr. Krabs into a baby.\nPlankton then leads Mr. Krabs in a telephone booth by money where he sprays Goo Goo Gas on him, turning Mr. Krabs into a baby, but Baby Krabs teethes on Plankton. SpongeBob finds Baby Krabs and takes him, but Plankton accidentally reveals to an overhearing SpongeBob that Baby Krabs is Mr. Krabs and his plans. SpongeBob literally calls the cops and Plankton gets arrested, but easily escapes. SpongeBob explains everything to an arriving Squidward, who immediately leaves.

Plankton sprays SpongeBob and he is now an adult again. The same thing happens again, and Plankton thinks it is not right. However, he gets launched out of the Krusty Krab by Mr. Krabs again. Later, Plankton uses a new spray, and sprays Mr. Krabs again. However, he notices Mr. Krabs is now elderly, realizing it was Senior Citizen Spray.\nSoon, SpongeBob appears out of nowhere and says a speech about caring for senior citizens. However, Plankton sprays him as well, and then says that they cannot catch him. Both SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs then trap Plankton by knitting a net, getting hit one by one by senior citizens.\nPlankton then realizes that there is one ingredient that he is missing to turn people into babies. He goes to Barg'N-Mart, where he buys baby powder, and then goes back to complete the experiment. Using Karen as a test subject, it works. He then returns to the Krusty Krab and sprays all the customers, including SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs, and they remain stuck as babies for the rest of the episode.

He comes back out from under the bottle, and realizes he's got the formula, to which he compares to taking candy from babies, he goes and mocks Mr. Krabs because of the irony and then he realizes Baby SpongeBob got ahold of his gas canister. He yells \"Hey, what are you doing?!\"\nBaby SpongeBob is seen laughing while bashing the canister on the ground. It flies into the air after a crack is put into the canister, the canister explodes, and releases gas everywhere, the gas reaches Plankton, which turns him into a microscopic baby, the scene cuts to Plankton, who is the size of an amoeba, realizing unlike the other babies the gas affected, he doesn't have a diaper.

SpongeBob goes to work for a restaurant named Fancy!, while the head chef, Le Schnook, works for the Krusty Krab.\nThings do not start out well for SpongeBob, as the owner Mr. Crustacean demands that he cook quality gourmet. Unfortunately, SpongeBob is quite literally incapable of cooking anything but Krabby Patties, to the degree where he cannot even fry an egg without it instantly transforming into a patty. Mr. Crustacean continues to yell at him until he actually tastes a patty. Realizing how good it tastes, he begins to sell them, to which all the rich clienteles enjoy. Eventually, SpongeBob's time there is up and he is about to return to the Krusty Krab. Unfortunately, that is not what Mr. Crustacean or the customers want. They attach themselves to his ankles and beg him not to go. SpongeBob has to drag them out of the restaurant.\nMeanwhile, things are not going well at the Krusty Krab. Le Schnook is none too pleased by Mr. Krabs' cheap attempts of setting up a lavish establishment. He refuses to cook unless his demands for expensive furniture, ingredients, and real silverware are met. As a result, the Krusty Krab goes completely bankrupt and out of business.\nMr. Krabs sells the decorations, his home possessions, his office desk and chair, along with Squidward to pay his debts and protect himself from the angry loan sharks. Pearl even calls him, thinking that their house has been infiltrated by burglars; Mr. Krabs assures his daughter that they are just repo men. Before returning to Fancy!, Le Schnook gives Mr. Krabs a long bill for his services. Mr. Krabs breaks down crying, realizing what giving away SpongeBob cost him.

{"prompt": "Atlantis SquarePantis", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob and Patrick are in Jellyfish Fields blowing bubbles. Patrick tries to take pictures of the bubbles, but they keep popping immediately before the picture is taken. SpongeBob sings a song. SpongeBob sings about how he wants to blow a bubble that would last all day. SpongeBob blows a bubble so big that it engulfs them both and carries them into a nearby cave. The bubble suddenly pops as it makes an impact with an ancient piece of gold.\nEager to discover what exactly it is, they decide to take it to the Bikini Bottom Museum, where they run into Squidward. At first, Squidward thinks that SpongeBob and Patrick were planning to steal the first half of the amulet, which is housed in the museum, but upon attempting to return it to its spot, he realizes that what Patrick and SpongeBob had was, in fact, the missing half. At this point, both Mr. Krabs and Sandy join them.\nThe pieces of gold are then reunited, which summons a luxurious bus (or 'van' as Squidward calls it) piloted by a robot and it's fueled by \"song.\" During the song to fuel the bus, it is revealed that Plankton has stowed away in a compartment at the front of the bus and plans to control the lost weapons of Atlantis and use them to steal the formula, much to the surprise of the viewers.\nOnce they arrive there, (accidentally crash-landing in a topiary garden) they meet the king of Atlantis, Lord Royal Highness, LRH for short, who shows them the riches, knowledge, and art of Atlantis. Meanwhile, Plankton escapes from the compartment and sneaks into the vault storing the weapons. After looking around at the weapons, he chooses to commandeer a tank (seemingly at random) to start his diabolical scheme.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Krabs enjoys the money vault, Sandy enjoys the science lab, and Squidward enjoys the hall of art (the rooms each had been planning to see). In the money vault, money, gold, and prized objects are found and mostly stashed in Mr. Krabs' pants pockets. In the science lab, Sandy enjoys the devices, a biomass-converting device that turns any household object into ice cream (a bug the Atlanteans have not worked out), a germ-fighting, interactive, micro video game, and makes an automatic feeding device. In addition, in the Hall of Arts, Squidward journeys through paintings, is modeled by painters, and even makes his own painting, claiming to have learned more about art in his short time in Atlantis than he did in four years of college.\nHowever, everything goes wrong when SpongeBob and Patrick are left alone with the World's Oldest Living Bubble. The flash from Patrick's camera when he takes a picture of themselves with the bubble causes it to burst, they are terrified, and the pair goes to dinner and insist on leaving. When Patrick reveals their mistake, LRH first doesn't believe it, and considers it dark humor. SpongeBob confirms it isn't a joke, to which LRH tells them that the bubble they popped was a prop for tourists like them, but when he shows them the real bubble, Patrick takes a picture of it, once again, with flash, and it also pops. LRH gets furious, drops the glass container, which shatters, and summons the Atlantean Royal Guards to seize the gang, Sandy uses Patrick like a boomerang, SpongeBob as a shield, Mr Krabs as a claw, and Squidward as a shotgun, they escape almost to which Plankton appears with a giant tank.\nPlankton lets out a huge speech about his victory with the collecting of the Atlantean arsenal, then he fires the tank at SpongeBob, the gang, and the Atlantean Royal Guards, but is foiled when it is revealed that the weapon he had chosen only shoots strawberry ice cream. He jumps out of the tank and in frustration, yelling \"OVERSIZED ICE CREAM MAKER!\" he kicks it, injuring himself. However, LRH seems delighted, saying, \"This talking speck will make a fantastic replacement for our recently deflated national treasure!\"\nHe grabs Plankton and puts him in a jar like the one for his bubble. Tourists start taking photos to which Plankton yells \"HEY! Can't you read?! No flash photography!\" They refuse.\nFinally, LRH loads SpongeBob and his friends back onto the bus and removes the amulet, giving it to one of his soldiers to dispose of to ensure no more \"visitors like these.\" SpongeBob is the only one eager to return to Bikini Bottom and sings. His friends (including Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, and even Patrick) get sad throughout the song. Squidward, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick start crying near the end of the song, but SpongeBob ignores and sings all along.\nPatchy is stuck in a rush-hour traffic jam on the US 101 in Encino, California. Then, his cell phone rings, and Potty warns him that he is going to miss the new SpongeBob cartoon if he doesn't get home soon. Patchy asks Potty to be a dear and record the episode for him, but Potty tells Patchy, \"Oh, I threw out that old Betamax machine in the garbage.\" Patchy gets mad, and to make matters worse, his super rare Frampton Comes Alive eight-track also breaks. He gets infuriated and questions if Potty even knows how important the cartoon is to him, Patchy yells at the person driving behind him, played by Paul Tibbitt, for honking at him because he is trying to talk to his parrot on the phone. Potty hangs up on him. Finally the traffic line opens up. Then, after Patchy gets his anchor in the boat, he drives off, but suddenly, he finds himself nowhere, and screams over what he assumes is the disappearance of Encino. He is in shock and his sunglasses break. Then, he cries that this is not the only time a lost city had been experienced. He introduces the episode as he suffers.\nAfter Plankton finds his tank, the scene cuts back to Patchy who states Encino is in fact still lost, but at least he got his eight-track radio fixed, to which he begins snapping his fingers to a beat, but not for long when it explodes again and produces smoke and sets on fire, he states \"Well, enjoy the rest of the show,\"\nPatchy later gets hallucinations after becoming dehydrated in the intense heat over running out of food and water and finds a man dressed in a tall SpongeBob outfit who tells him that he is SpongeBob in real-life form and that Patchy will return to Encino if he believes, leading into a happy, fast-paced musical montage of Patchy dancing around, walking to throw away a crumpled up piece of paper, having a picnic by himself, throwing a beach ball, getting a watermelon pelted at him hard and driving an old man reading a magazine, a mother and her baby crazy. Then, after Patchy accidentally drops his strawberry ice cream onto the grass, Potty wakes him up after Patchy mistakenly thinks Encino is back, which was all just a hallucination, as mentioned. Patchy begins to eat a sandwich, which Potty brings to him, but he finds mayonnaise on it, which he doesn't like because mayonnaise gets disgusting in high temperatures. He tries to give it to a vulture.\nAfter this, he finds Encino shrunk to a very small size. Then, he finds three aliens, which explain that their son, Norblock Five, was playing with his Shrinkatron again. Patchy yells at them that he wants his town back in full size and keeps saying, \"There's no place like home.\" Sympathetic over Patchy's loss, Norblock Five's mother gets the Shrinkatron given from her son and she presses the big red button control, making a tornado disaster to fix it up. Patchy is glad to be back in Encino with everything back to its original size watching the new SpongeBob cartoon he thought he was going to miss, but soon, a giant Potty the Parrot's foot stomps on him, closing the episode by showing that Norblock Five had possibly once again used his Shrinkatron to make Potty huge with Patchy reminding the audience to come back real soon for more of new segments featuring him as well as more new SpongeBob episodes."}

However, Patrick forgets the reason he came to the school and thinks he is jelly and takes him over to the table, where his peanut butter taco is. He dumps SpongeBob on it without knowing. SpongeBob lands in the taco, all dirty again. Patrick soon recalls the reason and watches SpongeBob start to cry. SpongeBob then sadly reveals the truth to Patrick about why the day for him was important, which it is that someday, he will graduate from school, and he doesn't want to be remembered as the guy in peanut butter and taco shells. He then bursts into tears.\nAs he cries, his teacher, Mrs. Puff, comes outside and drags him in kicking and screaming for the picture, despite SpongeBob's protesting. The cameraman sprays him with water to be clean and puts him in a green outfit that is a little small for the picture, but SpongeBob still doesn't smile.

Patrick says he could and proceeds to eat 50 Krabby Patties with extra cheese. When Mr. Krabs presents Patrick with the bill, Patrick realizes he does not have any money, so Mr. Krabs puts him to work to pay off the Krabby Patties as punishment for not paying for his meal.\nHowever, Patrick messes up on all of the jobs. He tries cleaning the bathroom floor, but Mr. Krabs catches him eating the hand soap (and commenting that it doesn't taste as good as it smells). He tries placing ice cube trays into a barrel, but he destroys the freezer and the ice cubes. So Mr. Krabs places him in a room with a large trash chute and threatens to never give him another Krabby Patty if he messes up this job, so Patrick places full trash bags into the machine, an easy job that he handles well until SpongeBob walks in to check on him. SpongeBob is carrying a bag of money that Mr. Krabs wants him to put in the safe. When Patrick is struggling to finish the job of getting rid of the garbage, SpongeBob tells him that he didn't flip the power switch down, so when he did, all the trash bags went down. Patrick thanks SpongeBob, but then he notices the money bag over SpongeBob's shoulder and immediately thinks he forgot one. He takes the sack, and despite SpongeBob's loud protests, places it into the shredder. Since it is full of money, the shredder cannot slice the bag up, so Patrick flips the power switch up and down, causing the compactor to expand just as Mr. Krabs walks in.\nSuddenly, the compactor and the Krusty Krab explode, and the sack of money, which was launched into the air, lands in the compactor, where it is shredded.

When SpongeBob finishes, SpongeBob stops the music and tells the situation. Captain Blue refuses to help, saying that if he was in SpongeBob's place, he will just go home and tells him that he's not cut out this type of work but he does drive him to BlackJack's house, which is ironically (and literally) right next door.

The warden has SpongeBob and Patrick digest the tires in a low, narrow hole with chum buried on top of them.\nThree days later, the warden lets SpongeBob and Patrick out of the hole, but they do not feel like they've been punished since they thought it was an enjoyable soak. The warden feels so ashamed that he makes the activities very boring and difficult. Apparently, SpongeBob and Patrick think that the \"Coal Breaking\" activity is fun and challenging even though they are wearing heavy ankle weights.\nSpongeBob comes to the conclusion that he and Patrick are having more fun than the other prisoners. Patrick suggests that they do a fun activity altogether, then they would be having the same amount of fun as each other. This hatches an idea in SpongeBob's brain, so he works on a play all night. The warden finds the script and in the morning he yells at the prisoners to find out which one of them wrote the paper. SpongeBob speaks up and says it is a play for \"amusement and inspiration.\"\nSpongeBob builds a boat for the play to take place in.

The counselor says that they make macaroni art, sing campfire songs, and help and support each other.\nSo, at the end of the episode, the inmates, prisoners, and SpongeBob and Patrick make macaroni art. Patrick confesses that he likes the other island better and so does SpongeBob, with the two still oblivious to the truth, and both of them start crying again."}
{"prompt": "To Save a Squirrel", "completion": "SpongeBob and Patrick start the episode running and screaming. They run into Sandy, explaining that a beast is chasing them. The \"beast\" is really a cricket from the surface. SpongeBob and Patrick notice that Sandy is packing food, water, dynamite, and tents in her jeep. SpongeBob and Patrick ask why she is packing. Sandy explains that she is packing for a camp in the wilderness. SpongeBob and Patrick ask if they can come, and Sandy says no because the camp is dangerous for them. When Sandy gets in her jeep, SpongeBob and Patrick sneak in her trunk to try to go to her camp. SpongeBob and Patrick fall out of the jeep when they are on their way there. The good news is that they fall out with food, water, and a tent.\nSpongeBob and Patrick are in the wilderness. SpongeBob tells Patrick that he will set up the tent while Patrick starts a campfire. When the tent is set up, Patrick is finished with the campfire. SpongeBob then notices that Patrick did not make a campfire, but rather burned their food instead. SpongeBob tries to put out the fire with the tent, but that just sets the tent on fire. He pours water on it, which makes it go out. SpongeBob drinks the remaining water. By now, SpongeBob and Patrick burned their food, ruined their tent, and lost their water. Then they notice a cave.\nThey go in the cave and find an old man. The old man explains that they are stuck in the cave now and that he was there for over 40 years. SpongeBob and Patrick try to make a shelter. SpongeBob is then convinced that Patrick wants to eat him. The old man explains to SpongeBob to eat Patrick before he eats SpongeBob. SpongeBob and Patrick then make attempts to eat each other.\nThe old man is impressed, and he then reveals that he is really Sandy. Sandy then gives SpongeBob and Patrick survival badges. SpongeBob and Patrick suddenly get an interest of eating Sandy. Sandy closes the episode saying, \"Next time I'll bring more granola.\""}
{"prompt": "Pest of the West", "completion": "The episode starts off at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob discovers that Patrick has a great-great-great-uncle named Patrick Revere, who warned Bikini Bottom that man-eating mollusks are coming, but no one listened to him.\nMr. Krabs tells the two of his great-great-grandpappy Krabs, who invented a painful security invention that hurts the fingers of anyone who touches the booby-trapped dollar bill. While walking, SpongeBob runs into Sandy, who reveals that she has a relative named Rosie Cheeks, who was the first squirrel to discover oil in Texas. Feeling sorry for SpongeBob, Sandy takes him to the library to \"dig around his family tree.\" SpongeBob learns that he is the great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandson of a Western hero, Sheriff SpongeBuck SquarePants. Sandy begins to tell SpongeBob the story of SpongeBuck SquarePants. In flashback, SpongeBuck arrived at a town named Dead Eye Gulch, which was formally named Bikini Gulch until it got taken over by a dangerous outlaw named \"Dead Eye,\" and goes to a theater/saloon named Krusty Kantina.\nSpongeBuck got to be a Sheriff by Pappy Krabs (Mr. Krabs' ancestor) even though he just wanted to be a fry cook. But then, a villain named Dead Eye Plankton (Plankton's ancestor) arrived there and SpongeBuck had to face him at high noon.\nSpongeBuck got kicked away into a desert, and Pecos Patrick Star (Patrick's ancestor) met him. SpongeBuck got a nickname for him, and it was Idiot Friend. Pecos Patrick told him to defeat Dead Eye Plankton by smacking him several times. When they get back to town (via a giant cactus that made SpongeBuck and Pecos Patrick jump so high that they landed in Dead Eye Gulch), SpongeBuck met Dead Eye Plankton, and the two walked towards each other as though it was a Western duel. However, the fight ended very quickly, as SpongeBuck stepped on Dead Eye Plankton. Something that has apparently never been done or thought of before in Dead Eye Gulch. Pappy Krabs also tried stomping on him, and he decided to set up a business where the townsfolk could squish Dead Eye. Polene Puff (Mrs. Puff's ancestor) was first in line to crush him. All the residents of Bikini Gulch give three yee-haws for SpongeBuck and built a golden statue of him in his honor (Squidward's ancestor liked his design better, which was him as a muscular man), and Pappy Krabs, Hopalong Squidward (Squidward's ancestor), Pecos Patrick, and Polene Puff holding SpongeBuck in a picture.\nSpongeBob is amazed by his ancestor's actions, but wonders whatever happened to his statue, as it seemed way better than the current one. SpongeBob soon realizes that the statue is really covered in jellyfish feces, hence the statue's different look. He cleans it up by scrubbing himself all across it, which disgusts Sandy, who wonders about SpongeBob's intelligence before he shows her the statue of his ancestor and she realizes his reasons. SpongeBob then sees the golden statue of his ancestor, SpongeBuck under the jellyfish poop, while apologizing to it for not recognizing it due to its earlier condition. After that, SpongeBob and Sandy walk away, while SpongeBob is saying that maybe someday, people will know the name SpongeBob SquarePants. \nThen, in the epilogue, SpongeBuck and Pecos Patrick sing a song called \"Idiot Friends\" to end the episode."}
{"prompt": "20,000 Patties Under the Sea", "completion": "While jellyfishing in Jellyfish Fields, SpongeBob and Patrick encounter an object sticking out of the ground in the beginning of the episode. They decide to dig it up, and they discover an old submarine. Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, Squidward and Mr. Krabs think of an idea to bring the Krusty Krab to the customers. SpongeBob and Patrick drive the submarine into the Krusty Krab, which gives the idea to Mr. Krabs to have SpongeBob and Patrick take the submarine and sell Krabby Patties to any passersby. Seeing this, Plankton gets upset since he had the idea years ago. He takes the fist of the Chum Bucket and uses it as a mobile Chum Bucket.\nSpongeBob and Patrick are unsuccessful with their first customers, so SpongeBob offers to pay them to take the Krabby Patties, which they agree to. Meanwhile, Plankton attempts to sell food to a child, whom he then insults out of impatience. All of a sudden, the child's parents, great grandmother, and various other fish start throwing rocks at Plankton after he insults them as well. Soon, the mob runs out of rocks, but since Patrick was not paying attention to the Krabby Patties, they burned and hardened. SpongeBob and Patrick are able to sell the burnt patties to the mob for them to throw, and the two friends head off.\nLater on, SpongeBob and Patrick fall into an abyss and wake up a ginormous sea monster who has been asleep for the past 79 years. Starved after his hibernation, the monster purchases 640 Krabby Patties. However, just as SpongeBob and Patrick are running out of patties, Plankton's Chum Bucket vehicle comes crashing into the submarine. Chum squeezes through the cracks of the submarine, so SpongeBob and Patrick decide to use the chum to make the burgers, which the monster ends up enjoying even more than the Krabby Patties. Plankton sees the sea monster hand SpongeBob and Patrick giant dollar bills in exchange for the chum burgers, and he attempts to get the monster to refuse the food. However, Plankton is mistaken for a chocolate éclair and the monster chases him away. Meanwhile, because they are down in the abyss, SpongeBob and Patrick have to let go of all the money they have earned to float back up to the surface. Instead of money, they bring back 37,000 pounds of decorative undersea rocks, much to Mr. Krabs' disappointment."}
{"prompt": "The Battle of Bikini Bottom", "completion": "The episode starts off at the Bikini Bottom Mall, SpongeBob and Patrick try on shirts that read \"Best Friend\" with arrows pointing to their sides. When they stand beside one another, their shirts point at each other. However, they discover that when either of them faces a different direction, the arrow points elsewhere, thus \"sending out the wrong signals.\" Annoyed with their antics, the security guards kicked SpongeBob and Patrick out of the mall. In seeking out new friendship clothes, the pair finds a group of citizens donning traditional military uniforms. Mistaking the uniforms for \"matching outfits,\" they are taught that the fish are participating in a reenactment of the Battle of Bikini Bottom. When SpongeBob reveals that he is unaware of the historical event, Patrick erroneously recounts the conflict, (sounding like he was part of it too) between two supposed factions: the clean, obsessed with personal hygiene, and the dirty, unconcerned with such matters.\nSpongeBob, upon realizing that Patrick sympathizes with the filthy side, expresses his disgust. He didn't realize it when they went out for ice cream, and had Krabby Patties at Fancy!. The two begin to argue, to the annoyance of the fish trying to recreate the actual battle. SpongeBob and Patrick appropriate uniforms and engage in their own reenactment of Patrick's imagined war, driving the fish away. SpongeBob and Patrick commence their battle, exchanging a series of volleys in which SpongeBob attempts to bolster Patrick's cleanliness and Patrick attempts to defile SpongeBob's sanitary nature. At the Krusty Krab, while SpongeBob still screaming that he scared from Patrick's booger, Patrick traps him, but unfortunately SpongeBob throws onion directly at Patrick's eyes, causing him to cry. Next Patrick makes fun with Patty Socks, but SpongeBob doesn't really like it. Later he unleashes his ultimate rage by turning red and inflating himself like a balloon, creating an explosive blast that sends Patrick into the dumpster. This culminates in a standoff in which SpongeBob consumes a soap bar and prepares to pelt Patrick with soap bubbles shot through his pores. Patrick, in retaliation, picks up a dumpster and hurls it at SpongeBob as he starts his assault. The bubbles scour Patrick off his feet just as the dumpster lands on SpongeBob.\nIn the aftermath, Patrick is made squeaky clean and SpongeBob is covered in filth. As they reflect upon the copious amounts of cleaning/soiling that it will take to return them to their respective states of tidiness/mess, they realize that this only means that they are provided an opportunity to indulge in what they each love to do. As they reconcile, the fish return, intolerant of a stalemate. SpongeBob gives a sermon on the duality of their conflict, and makes a case for neutrality on the basis that one side cannot exist without another to provide reference to each other. The fish dismiss SpongeBob's message, forgoing the frilliness of reconciliation for \"more manly\" pastimes. Satisfied, SpongeBob and Patrick walk into the sunset to end the episode."}
{"prompt": "What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?", "completion": "In this episode, SpongeBob wakes up on a usual day. He looks out his window and sees the mailman riding by on his bike. He says \"Hi\" to the mailman. This greeting causes the mailman to get distracted, and a truck crashes into him. After that, SpongeBob wants to spend time with his friends; however, he ends up upsetting them: he accidentally breaks Gary's shell, ruins Patrick's cake for his mother's birthday, disturbs Squidward's beauty sleep (as usual), destroys Sandy's new invention (a robot), and accidentally deep fries Mr. Krabs' money, and himself. After everyone furiously tells him to go away and angrily calls him \"Idiot Boy,\" a devastated SpongeBob, who believes that all his friends hate him, and feeling guilty for causing so much trouble, decides to leave Bikini Bottom. After saying good-bye to Gary, who just hisses at him due to still being upset, and leaving him a year’s supply of food, he does precisely that. At night, SpongeBob is scared by mysterious figures in the shadows. While he runs from the creatures, SpongeBob falls off a cliff and bumps his head. After noticing a lump on his head, SpongeBob gets knocked unconscious by his bundle. \nBack in Bikini Bottom, Patrick, who is oblivious to how much he hurt SpongeBob’s feelings earlier, is knocking on SpongeBob's door, wanting to borrow his hot sauce for his milkshake. He is approached by Sandy, who is wondering where SpongeBob is, also oblivious to the fact SpongeBob is gone. Hearing that Patrick has no clue where SpongeBob is and having no time to wait for him to answer the door, Sandy decided to karate their way into the Pineapple home. After entering the house, the two find Gary huge and overweight and moaning for SpongeBob to come help him due to having a stomachache from eating all the food that SpongeBob left him, oblivious to the fact that he left. Being asked what happened to him, Gary sadly shows Sandy and Patrick his food bowl with a note from SpongeBob inside, explaining that he has run away so that he wouldn't bother anyone ever again, which leaves both of them feeling remorseful, especially after the note reminds them that they cruelly called him \"Idiot Boy.\"\nMeanwhile, SpongeBob regains consciousness, then notices a fish couple, who thought he was taking a \"dirt nap,\" as they try to steal his possessions but pretend to say that they were organizing them. Hearing one of the fish call him by name, SpongeBob becomes confused and unsure. After being asked if he doesn’t know his own name, SpongeBob explains to the fish couple that all he knows is that he hit his head but now he can't seem to remember anything. Hearing this, the fish couple realize that SpongeBob has amnesia as they decide to take advantage of his memory loss so they can steal his possessions by telling him that the items aren't his and give him a new name, \"CheeseHead BrownPants.\" However, SpongeBob felt something in his pockets then reaches inside them to find a bottle of bubble soap, which causes the couple to run off for some reason. After the couple leaves, SpongeBob wonders what got into them. He then notices a city nearby.\nAt Bikini Bottom, everything is in chaos, especially the Krusty Krab, because SpongeBob is not there to give Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs asks Squidward where SpongeBob is as he is freaking out that there are no Krabby Patties being made, then they both get into an argument after Squidward insults Mr. Krabs. However, after hearing Sandy and Patrick arriving, Mr. Krabs and Squidward are asked by them if they have seen SpongeBob. Hearing that none of them have seen him, Sandy shows the note SpongeBob left while informing Mr. Krabs and Squidward that he has left town due to causing trouble, and that he is not coming back. Mr. Krabs takes the note SpongeBob left from Sandy and reads it. After reading the note, Mr. Krabs sees that SpongeBob did write it, and that he left because everyone called him Idiot Boy. He then not only panics because the latter is gone, but also because he feels guilty for pushing him away, and he wonders how he'll survive without his best fry cook. Feeling guilt-ridden for being mean to SpongeBob as well, Patrick and Sandy break down crying, with the obvious exception of Squidward, who is delighted and remorselessly laughs in joy, even stating he would've slammed his door in his face even harder if he knew that would be the last time he would see him. Deciding to do a group meeting with just himself, Patrick, Sandy, and Squidward, Mr. Krabs kicks everyone out of the Krusty Krab, then tells everyone that the restaurant is closed until the group can find SpongeBob and bring him back to Bikini Bottom.\nMeanwhile, SpongeBob wanders into New Kelp City, name of the city that he saw nearby before, where he bumps into a business man. Believing he tried to steel money from him, the business man tells SpongeBob that if he wants money then get a job and insults him, which makes him think that because of his amnesia and sadly continues walking. However, SpongeBob gets hungry but discovers that he's broke and attempts to get a job. Each time he gets a job, SpongeBob uses his bubble blowing ability to help him, though, like the couple he encountered, this strikes fear into all the residents of the city, therefore resulting in him being fired.\nBack in Bikini Bottom, Sandy shows her friends her new invention that can track SpongeBob, the Sponge-Tracker. But Squidward, not wanting SpongeBob to come back, purposefully destroys the device with a hammer, claiming he dropped it. Furious and not buying his blatant lie, Mr. Krabs scolds Squidward for his action, then orders him to find SpongeBob, but he still refuses to help, even being unfazed when his boss threatens to fire him. Desperate to not only get his station working again, but also wanting his close friend back just as much as Patrick and Sandy do, Mr. Krabs comes up with the perfect method to get Squidward to cooperate with the search for SpongeBob as he offers him a jeweled Fabergé egg as a retirement gift, which the latter notes will complete his collection. However, Mr. Krabs tells Squidward that if he wants it, he'll have to bring SpongeBob back to Bikini Bottom. This offer finally convinces Squidward, who chooses his love of art over his hatred of SpongeBob, to help with the search party.\nIn New Kelp City, SpongeBob's bubble blowing activities attracts the attention of The Bubble Poppin' Boys, a menacing street gang who have scared the city into never blowing bubbles ever again since the bubbles burn their eyes. They decide to show him what they do to rule breakers by beating up a scared SpongeBob, who quickly runs off as the gang chases him until he is cornered. SpongeBob then uses his bubble blowing ability to trap them in a large bubble, and it sends them out the city, which frees the town of their reign. As a result, SpongeBob is rewarded the position of mayor of New Kelp City by its previous owner, who immediately retires. Meanwhile, Patrick, Sandy, and Squidward are searching for SpongeBob as they decided to stop at a gas station to see if anyone seen their friend. After noticing a newspaper with SpongeBob in it, Sandy sees that her friend is now mayor of New Kelp City.\nBack in New Kelp City, SpongeBob is giving a speech while Patrick, Sandy and Squidward are in the audiences as they come to retrieve him. After SpongeBob gives his speech, Sandy uses a megaphone to get his attention as she tells the surrounding citizens and her friend that she doesn't mean to put a damper on the mood there, but Bikini Bottom needs him back. However, due to his amnesia, SpongeBob doesn't know who Sandy is or the town she is talking about. Sandy goes up on stage, then apologizes for lashing out at him before. Seeing Sandy more closely, SpongeBob became surprised to see her and she thought he was talking about finding him, but becomes shocked that he doesn't recognize her when he mistakes her for a weasel, which he is surprised about. Sandy thinks SpongeBob is pretending that he doesn't remember her, but he does apologize to her for not remembering her and comments that he probably would, although he still thinks she is a weasel. Patrick comes up on stage as he hopes that SpongeBob hasn't forgotten about him, then shows him a half of a friendship tattoo he has while he has the other half. However, seeing the tattoo, SpongeBob gets confused as to how he got that, then explains to the two that all he remembers is hitting his head, blowing some bubbles and now poof, he's mayor. \nAfter hearing SpongeBob's explanation and realizing as to why he called himself CheeseHead BrownPants during his speech, Sandy is convinced that her friend really doesn't remember who he is or who they are as she concludes that he got his memory loss when he hit his head. Wanting to bring her friend home and help him, Sandy asks SpongeBob to come back with them to Bikini Bottom as she explains to him that the familiar surroundings of the town will bring his memory right back. However, SpongeBob refuses because everyone in New Kelp City needs his leadership. When SpongeBob gets into a limo to attend a meeting that he's late for, Sandy tries to stop him from leaving, but becomes surprised when the limo comes back around and is shocked to see that Squidward managed to hijack the vehicle. Sandy and Patrick get into the limo, and then Squidward drives everyone with SpongeBob back to Bikini Bottom.\nThey take SpongeBob back to the Krusty Krab, but he still can't recall anything. Although he is surprised to hear that SpongeBob doesn't recognize the eatery, Mr. Krabs thinks he is kidding, then gives him his spatula. However, Mr. Krabs realizes that SpongeBob really did lose his memory when he became surprised that he was a fry cook before. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that he's the best in his business, then asks him to get flipping. However, not entirely convinced of everyone's claims as to who and what he is, SpongeBob nicely tells them that he would like to, but he wants to return to New Kelp City and run as mayor, claiming it is a modest job. Squidward, who doesn't care if SpongeBob stays or not, demands the Fabergé egg from Mr. Krabs since he brought him back, on a technicality. Mr. Krabs sadly agrees and reluctantly hands Squidward the jeweled egg. As Squidward marvels on his new jeweled egg being so beautiful, he slips on the greasy spatula that SpongeBob put on the floor, causing the egg to fly out of his hands. The egg shatters as it hits SpongeBob on the head, much to Squidward's distress, and the impact gave him another lump. After getting a hold of himself and telling a concerned Sandy that he is fine but he just has a bit of a headache, SpongeBob realizes that his memory is returning when he recognizes the eatery. Overjoyed that their friend got his memory back, Mr. Krabs, also on behalf of Patrick, Sandy, and Squidward, tell SpongeBob how really sorry they all are for running him out town because of the harsh stuff they said about him, but they're glad he is back. Even though he wants to stay in Bikini Bottom and accepts his friends' apology, SpongeBob knows that New Kelp City needs their mayor. Everyone is confused and distraught that SpongeBob will leave again, except for Squidward, who is delighted at this as he feels that it will make up for the loss of his Faberge egg.\nAt that moment, a news report comes on the TV saying that the bubbles in New Kelp City are causing mayhem and that he can't see with all the bubbles. A thug then threatens SpongeBob if he ever came back to New Kelp City. Upon hearing this, SpongeBob has second thoughts about going back to New Kelp City and decides to remain in Bikini Bottom. Before the episode ends, a dismayed Squidward opens his head and throws his brain in a trash can."}

SpongeBob and Patrick sing \"Squidward Had a Krabby Patty.\" Squidward becomes very annoyed, so he tells them to stop. However, they ignore him and continue singing, so Squidward goes to the door of the kitchen to yell at them, but just as he reaches the door, the door swings open as SpongeBob comes out singing, and it hits Squidward in the face. Squidward is in great pain, and yells at SpongeBob to take him to the hospital. At the hospital, SpongeBob is nervously pacing up and down and chewing on Krusty Krab hats, when Incidental 116 opens the door to the waiting room. SpongeBob bursts into tears and asks if Squidward is going to be okay, to which Incidental 116 replies by saying they will not know for two weeks.\nTwo weeks later, SpongeBob goes into the hospital holding a bouquet of flowers. He gives one of the flowers to Mable, who is apparently suffering from amnesia, and then he walks into Squidward's operation room. Incidental 116 says that Squidward had asked to keep SpongeBob far away from him, but SpongeBob promises to stay out of the way. Just as Incidental 116 is about to cut the bandages, SpongeBob interrupts him, saying to not rush it. He then interrupts a second time, asking if Squidward has enough \"emensmansera,\" to which the doctor says he has never heard of. SpongeBob then interrupts a third time, saying the readings on a brain meter (which is actually a television) are wrong, and a fourth time with a television program. SpongeBob interrupts once more as the doctor angrily wonders what the reason is as SpongeBob ironically says it was to apologize for interrupting him, and the bandages are finally cut. Squidward's face is so handsome it causes the doctor and a nurse to faint, and when Squidward looks in a mirror, he is thrilled to see he really is handsome.\nAs Squidward is walking through town, multiple fish see him, call him handsome, and faint. One fish crashes a car, an old lady regains the ability to walk, a blind fish regains the ability to see, and one fish becomes able to fly. Many fish begin taking photographs of Squidward, and one asks for an autograph. Squidward is enjoying the attention. A limo is waiting for Squidward and SpongeBob, which return them to Squidward's house. Many fans follow the limo, and take pictures of Squidward as he walks to his house. Squidward goes to sleep, while a group of fish is chanting 'handsome handsome handsome' outside his house all night. In the morning, Squidward remembers he is handsome, and goes out to greet the crowd, which has grown significantly over night. Suddenly, the fans start trying to take his shirt and eyelids, and Squidward rushes back inside. Squidward instead decides to play them a song on his clarinet, and the crowd cheers for him. But then, someone grabs his clarinet from him as he is leaning out the window, and that fish is attacked by the crowd who also want the clarinet.\nSquidward tries to take his mind off the incident by having an herbal bath, but someone reaches through the window and grabs his soap. Squidward tries to enjoy his bath, but a huge fish emerges from his bath, and then fish start coming through his window, door, and even toilet, and try to 'get' him. Squidward jumps out the window, but the crowd is still outside, and they start to approach him. He runs into SpongeBob's house, who is trimming his toenails, and Squidward begs SpongeBob to help him get his old life back. SpongeBob and Squidward cut through the crowd and run to the Krusty Krab, with the crowd chasing after them.\nWhen they arrive, Mr. Krabs is thrilled to see a crowd of people outside the Krusty Krab and tells the crowd they can pay to touch Squidward. Squidward asks SpongeBob to smash the door in his face before Mr. Krabs opens the doors to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob does not want to hurt Squidward on purpose, but Squidward tells SpongeBob to hurt him or he will hurt SpongeBob, so SpongeBob repeatedly slams the door in Squidward's face. This ends up making Squidward even more handsome, then suddenly a shoe falls through a hole in the roof. Before it hits Squidward in the head, SpongeBob shoves him out of the way, and he stumbles face first into a pole. This returns Squidward's face to normal and the crowd leaves in disappointment. In an attempt to bring them back, Mr. Krabs repeatedly slams the door into Squidward's face, but to no avail, which ends the episode from there."}

Nat and Shubie were leaving the diner, and their bag of leftovers flew into SpongeBob's bedroom window and hit him in the face, causing him to look out the window. As he does so, the wind gets into his pores and makes music, attracting the jellyfish.\nThe next morning, SpongeBob tries to go to work, but the jellyfish swarm him, wanting to play. Eventually, Mr. Krabs is forced to bring him in with a fishing rod, and as SpongeBob goes to make Krabby Patties, the window abruptly opens. As the breeze blows through SpongeBob's pores and produces the melodious tune once again, the jellyfish chase him.\nStill being pursued by the swarm of jellyfish, SpongeBob runs to hide in Patrick's house; however, a jellyfish enters and stings Patrick, making him throw SpongeBob out. Finally, the wind stops, but the jellyfish then begin to sting SpongeBob, forcing him to take refuge in a cave.\nWith that, he starts building a stone replica of himself to alleviate his days of solitude. Later, the storm is still there, and SpongeBob had grown a beard and finished the replica. He gives his inanimate companion tea with sugar cubes and talks to it about how the jellyfish keep bothering him due to the music produced when the wind blows through his holes. Then, SpongeBob has an idea to use the stone replica of himself to produce a song to distract the jellyfish.\nSpongeBob carries the stone replica of himself outside of the cave, but the jellyfish end up hating the music produced by the replica. As a result, the jellyfish sting SpongeBob again, forcing him to go back to the cave. SpongeBob comes to the realization that bigger stones can produce bigger and better music.\nAfter a while, SpongeBob finishes the giant stone replicas and pushes them into the middle of Jellyfish Fields, forming a circle. Said circle full of SpongeBob statues is now known as \"SpongeHenge.\" The breeze blowing through the pores of the giant statues creates beautiful and harmonious music, which the jellyfish love. SpongeBob is overjoyed that he will never worry about the jellyfish ever again, and he is finally able to go back to work. Unfortunately, he discovers that the Krusty Krab is now deserted and sinking into the ground. SpongeBob now realizes how much time the jellyfish made him waste and cries out in despair.\nThree thousand years later, a race of strange cyborgs have appeared in Jellyfish Fields. \"SpongeHenge\" has become a major tourist attraction with many tourists taking pictures of the sight. The cyborgs wonder who made the statues and why they were made.

An elderly woman named Miss Gristlepuss enters the Krusty Krab with her accomplices, and, being unhappy with what they see, they ban Krabby Patties.\nMr. Krabs causes the Krusty Krab to be closed by threatening Miss Gristlepuss with a french fry strainer and insulting her by calling her a disgusting old prune, not knowing her husband, Al, is the police chief. Meanwhile, Plankton at first thinks Mr. Krabs has changed the name to \"The Closed Krab,\" but soon figures out he can take advantage of the moment and goes out to celebrate. Plankton soon discovers in surprise that the Krusty Krab has secretly been reopened at SpongeBob's house. Patrick, serving as a guard, asks Plankton for the password to enter, to which Plankton responds with a series of threats. Surprisingly enough, these threats constitute the password and Plankton is allowed in.\nWhile Mr. Krabs scans to make sure the area is clear of police officers, he goes to check on SpongeBob, who is afraid of getting arrested for making an illegal product. Mr. Krabs forces him to work, threatening to make him take weekends off. Plankton discovers Mr. Krabs is doing his regular business \"under the table\" and calls the cops.

Shocked, SpongeBob panics and jumps backward, and his cousin Stanley then comes out, whom SpongeBob recognizes immediately. They do a victory screech, and then SpongeBob asks him why he has come. Stanley produces a letter for SpongeBob from his Uncle Sherm. It states that Stanley cannot hold a job because he destroys everything he touches, and he can't take it anymore. Hoping SpongeBob can deal with Stanley better, he sent Stanley to him.\nSpongeBob is happy to take Stanley in, and Stanley immediately rushes to the refrigerator, stating that Uncle Sherm never let him near the refrigerator. He then throws everything out of it and rushes to the bathroom. He causes the toilet to flood and then rushes to the television. However, he flicks through the channels too quickly and causes the television to explode. Stanley then admires pictures of SpongeBob working at the Krusty Krab, which SpongeBob says is his calling. Stanley is sad because he doesn't have a calling, and SpongeBob decides to see if Squidward can help him.\nSquidward gets scared because there are two \"SpongeBobs\" and moves out (which only takes ten seconds) because he thinks that he is going to get annoyed. Next, SpongeBob takes Stanley to see Sandy. When he is about to shake her hand, he trips over a rock, and his buck teeth tear a hole in Sandy's suit, sending her flying upwards. SpongeBob then takes Stanley to see Patrick, and Patrick asks him if there is anything he is good at. Stanley says there is nothing he is good at, so Patrick decides to test how good he is 'at nothing'. Patrick tells Stanley to clear his mind and do absolutely nothing, but Stanley just can't resist the urge to move, and yells that he can't do it, and Patrick tells him to leave.\nSpongeBob's watch then beeps, alerting him that it is time to go to work, and SpongeBob, temporarily forgetting Stanley's problem, puts on his hat and says Stanley has no idea how good it feels. This causes Stanley to start crying, and SpongeBob says maybe Stanley watching SpongeBob work will cheer him up.

SpongeBob suggests he should have a nose implanted on his face, and so they go to a plastic surgery clinic known as Noses 'n Things.\nAfter the surgery, Patrick removes the bandages on his nose and is thrilled. He goes around town smelling several nice things such as perfume, pastries, freshly cut grass and deodorant. However, he soon comes across some rotten onion rings and is repulsed by the smell. Patrick runs home, but upon realizing how terrible his own house smells, decides to completely disinfect the place. After 48 hours, SpongeBob comes by and Patrick's nose picks up another bad scent. He traces it to Squidward's imported cheese and destroys it with a rocket gun.\nPatrick then goes and plugs up SpongeBob's sweaty holes as he is working out, stocks the Krusty Krab with scented candles and air freshener (chasing away all the customers), and sprays Sandy with air freshener. Fed up, the gang decides to have a meeting where they contemplate punishing Patrick via physical harm. SpongeBob stops them from doing so and tells them that it is not Patrick's fault: it is his new nose that is causing him to act like this. He suggests using something that smells so terrible, it will get rid of Patrick's nose.\nThey bring a huge ball of garbage to Patrick's door, which causes his nose to shrivel up and disintegrate. Replying that he just wanted to be like them, Patrick runs away crying over his loss of his nose. At the funeral, SpongeBob feels quite regretful for getting rid of Patrick's nose (even Sandy agrees), but Squidward remains unconcerned, declaring that he could not care less, and insults Patrick, who says, \"I heard that!\" with large ears, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Patty Caper", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, Mr. Krabs summons SpongeBob to his office, where he tells SpongeBob that he has run low on the secret ingredient of the Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he is expecting a delivery to refill it and tells him to retrieve it from a S.W.A.T. truck driver, but threatens punishment if he loses it.\nAfter receiving the case, SpongeBob opens the briefcase, only to find the ingredient is not there. However, the only clue left is a small hole in the briefcase, as Patrick appears to see him and SpongeBob tells him of what occurred. SpongeBob and Patrick then go on a mission to find out who stole it.\nFirst, they suspect Plankton, since he is the only one that has ever tried to steal a Krabby Patty and since he had a Krabby Patty. Plankton asks if it is a joke, then to make him tell the truth, Patrick threatens him with clackers, with still no answer. SpongeBob picks up the \"Krabby Patty\" and shows it to Plankton, who then explains that he learned every ingredient but the secret ingredient and tested many ingredients to decipher the formula completely and was currently on Raw Sewage.\nNext, they suspect Sandy, who is storing Krabby Patties for the winter, but says she just ordered them. SpongeBob's story of Sandy's crime was that she used an invisible potion to make her vanish, so nobody can see her. She then used her time-freezing invention to shoot a laser blast through the briefcase and take off, continuing the timeline again. However, Sandy brings up the possibility of simply ordering the food. To prove her point, she angrily shows SpongeBob a receipt for 283 patties and the nervous SpongeBob remembers cooking the order and apologizes for the accusations. She suggests that they should go and look at SpongeBob's house.\nAt SpongeBob's pineapple, the friends suspect Gary. SpongeBob suggests that Gary took a helicopter ride towards the delivery, so when SpongeBob knelt down to fix his socks and while everyone was distracted, Gary parachuted down and used his acid from his tear ducts to melt a hole big enough for him to grab the briefcase. Gary says it would not be possible, and SpongeBob realizes he would never stop to pull up his sock during a secret delivery. Gary says he saw someone leaving the Krusty Krab with a black case. Gary describes the person to Patrick and Patrick concludes the person is Squidward.\nThey interrogate Squidward, who does have a black case, but when they open the case, they find it just holds tap dancing shoes Squidward used at a tap dancing contest, where he got third place.\nWith no one left to suspect, SpongeBob goes back to the Krusty Krab and admits to Mr. Krabs that he lost the secret ingredient and that he cannot find it or who took it. Mr. Krabs then suspects SpongeBob, much to his horror and shock, suggesting that the latter used a decoy to look like he was picking up the delivery, then when everyone was not looking, SpongeBob swooped in, took the briefcase, and then flew it over to the Chum Bucket, where he sold it to Plankton for a quick buck. SpongeBob tries to say he didn't, but Mr. Krabs shuts him up and almost calls the cops, but two officers hop out of a barrel and explain that they have already heard everything.\nMr. Krabs then points at SpongeBob for the officers to arrest, accidentally revealing the secret ingredient in Mr. Krabs' hand which SpongeBob points out. Realizing Mr. Krabs to be the true thief and that he was going to let SpongeBob take the blame for the caper, the officers confront him. Mr. Krabs sheepishly explains to the cops that he considered $1.99 for the delivery to be too expensive, so he took it to avoid paying. However, the officers arrest him for the theft, attempting to frame SpongeBob, and his cheap nature. Rather than admit what he did was wrong, Mr. Krabs frantically asks what he did.\nAfter his arrest, the judge punishes him by giving away free Krabby Patties for a day, to his horror. Mr. Krabs states he could not bear the sight of doing such a thing. The next day, SpongeBob gives away the patties, while Mr. Krabs is forcibly watching the scene strapped to a chair while the officers hold onto his eyes as he screams in agony at the sight as the officers laugh, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Plankton's Regular", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, Plankton is crying about having no customers, when a fish named Nat comes asking for a chumstick. A disbelieving Plankton gives Nat the chumstick, who says it is so good that he will return the next day. Plankton is overjoyed by this and brags to Karen, (who seems barely shaken about it). The next day, Plankton waits at the door with a chumstick for Nat. After eight hours of waiting (Plankton falls asleep while waiting but is woken by the clock), Nat finally comes, eats the chumstick, and tells Plankton he has a regular customer on his hands.\nAt the Krusty Krab, Plankton appears on Mr. Krabs' desk. When the latter traps him underneath a spoon, Plankton assures gloats about having a regular customer, assuring Mr. Krabs that they will no longer be competing. Mr. Krabs laughs at him and shows off all his customers eating Krabby Patties. Then Nat appears at the restaurant and in front of Mr. Krabs (who's holding Plankton) requests a chumstick. The scene ends with Nat carrying Plankton back to the Chum Bucket, with Plankton mocking Mr. Krabs and insulting him.\nMr. Krabs explains the situation to SpongeBob and orders him to redirect Nat to being a Krusty Krab customer through multiple attempts (mostly shoving a Krabby Patty into his face and at one point forcing him to eat it) unsuccessful. Mr. Krabs bursts into tears at these failures, saying that he cannot afford for Plankton to have even just one customer. SpongeBob says that if he wants Nat to eat at the Krusty Krab, he will have to make chum as good as Plankton's. This gives Mr. Krabs the idea to steal the chum recipe.\nThat night, Mr. Krabs sneaks into the Chum Bucket trying to steal Plankton's recipe, but Plankton catches him with a security system that involves trapping him under a giant spoon (a likely reference to when he was trapped under one). SpongeBob then grabs Plankton and starts talking about the irony of the situation, but Plankton then uses the spoon security system on SpongeBob as well. After Plankton reveals the name of his system, Karen shows on screen that Nat is headed for the Chum Bucket with a fortune.\nOnly when Nat arrives he throws the money at Karen, calling off the deal, announcing that the chum made him get his stomach pumped soon to be three times before he's carried off by paramedics for his 3rd stomach pump. Karen reveals to Plankton that she has been bribing Nat to eat his chum so that he would stop complaining about having no customers. This causes Plankton to feel depressed once again, calling himself \"a waste of a lower life form\" (to which Karen tells him unsympathetically to cut it out) before crying. Meanwhile, SpongeBob mentions to Mr. Krabs about making a hasty retreat (they are still trapped under the spoons) but he decides to stay, enjoying and laughing at Plankton's misery as SpongeBob just watches in stunned silence as the episode ends."}

However, Squidward already gave SpongeBob five dollars to leave him alone yesterday. He gets annoyed, so Squidward begins walking away. He then finds out that SpongeBob is following him, so he starts running and he jumps onto his boat. However, he cannot find the keys and then SpongeBob arrives at Squidward's boat.

During class, Squidward is forced to sit next to SpongeBob. Then Mrs. Puff asks Squidward why he is enrolled in Boating School, so he tells everyone in the class while SpongeBob heavily breathes during this, annoying Squidward. After, Mrs. Puff tells SpongeBob to illustrate his side of the story, but SpongeBob just draws a picture with him and Squidward saying \"SpongeBob and Squidward, Best Boating Buddies Forever\" on the chalkboard.\nLater, during lunchtime, Squidward tries to avoid SpongeBob. He then decides to eat in the bathroom, but he sees SpongeBob's feet. Squidward angrily throws his sandwich on the floor, bangs the door and yells at SpongeBob, but when it opens, it is revealed to not be SpongeBob, but rather, a tough guy. Squidward awkwardly freaks out that he thought it was SpongeBob and gets beaten up. He arrives back in class with SpongeBob, and Mrs. Puff tells him that he has to drive with SpongeBob for a test.

But when SpongeBob tries to help him, Squidward snaps at him exclaiming that they are not \"Boating Buddies\" and he never wants help from him ever again. SpongeBob's feelings are hurt. However, Squidward cannot do the test because he cannot pick up the pencil, so he asks for SpongeBob's help; when the sponge reminds him of what he said, Squidward denies it, only for his voice to have been recorded by another student. Finally, when Squidward admits that he and SpongeBob are \"Boating Buddies,\" SpongeBob cheers. But time runs out and Squidward asks Mrs. Puff what to do. She then says that he needs to come back the next week to retake the test.

Mr. Krabs looks at the newspaper and finds out that they charge 25 cents per word, much to his delight. Due to this, Mr. Krabs decides to open his own newspaper business. The next day, SpongeBob finds out that Mr. Krabs has given him new responsibilities: being the lead reporter for the Krabby Kronicle, and he is then given a badge and a camera.\nAfter finding no interesting stories (though there are many newsworthy stories like a thief robbing a bank, two muscular fishes smashing a car, and a giant monster coming out of the sewers), SpongeBob finds Patrick waiting for the bus. Deciding that this common event would make a juicy story, SpongeBob takes a picture of the scene, but Patrick insists that he is only watching the pole so that the next time it moves, he will be there to see it. At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is expecting huge profits for the Krabby Kronicle, only for Squidward to tell him nobody is buying the paper as the stories are too boring. Mr. Krabs is confused at first, but as soon as he looks at the Krabby Kronicle and sees that things like Patrick watching a pole are what passes for news with SpongeBob, he is not at all surprised. Upset by this nonsense, he tells SpongeBob that his stories are not good enough, as nobody would be caught dead reading about such trivial things. He then turns the story of Patrick watching a pole into Patrick marrying a pole. SpongeBob says that it's lying. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that it is not lying: it is instead giving the people something to laugh about.\nAfter this, SpongeBob writes several lies about people, which leads to Mrs. Puff losing her reputation as a good boating teacher, Larry being kicked out of the gym, the Chum Bucket being shut down by Health Inspector Yellowtail Andy, and Sandy's science trophies being confiscated by the Neptunian Science Committee. SpongeBob tries to convince Mr. Krabs to find a way to write good stories without hurting people, but Mr. Krabs does not listen, threatening to take his spatula away if he doesn't follow orders. That night, Mr. Krabs tells him to give him the wildest story ever and he spends the entire night fabricating one.\nThe next day, Mr. Krabs is shocked to discover an angry mob (led by Martha) in his restaurant. It turns out SpongeBob wrote a story about Mr. Krabs overworking him and forcing him to write lies that ruins other people's lives.

Mr. Krabs breaks down crying in the kitchen, missing his money so much that he is not even upset with SpongeBob for exposing his deceit.\nHowever, Krabs finds a single dollar that the angry mob missed. He decides to use the printer to print counterfeit money. He tells SpongeBob to get some scissors so he can start using his imagination with the printer.

One of the owners, named Charles, asks his pet Foofie why he is so angry and asks everybody who can understand what the pets are saying. SpongeBob explains what Gary is saying and says that the pets do not want to be in these pet shows because they want to be treated fair and want to be themselves instead of being treated like \"rag dolls in scratchy outfits,\" and then the riot is over. SpongeBob apologizes to Gary for forcing him to enter the pet show and promises to not ever do it again, much to Gary's happiness. SpongeBob and Gary are rewarded by the judge.

Meanwhile, at the post office, a garbageman (who reveals to be a Viking) notices it and delivers the letter to the Viking Chief.\nThe chief then sends his men to the Krusty Krab to teach them about the Vikings (which is redecorating, appropriating, and liberating), and they abduct SpongeBob and Squidward.\nThe Vikings bring SpongeBob and Squidward to their ship, where the captain, Gordon, introduces his crew, which all share the name, Olaf. SpongeBob asks what they do for fun (which is just throwing a shield), and one of the Vikings says they like to sing songs, even though they actually do not sing, and he then gets catapulted off the ship. The Vikings proceed to make SpongeBob the head chef, and Squidward the bathroom attendant. Soon afterward, Squidward complains about the poor lifestyle, which results in the Vikings tying him to a catapult in an effort to launch him off of their ship. Soon, the Vikings discover that they have hit a rock and that their boat will leak, which gives SpongeBob an idea. He then plugs up the boat with his porous appearance, and saves the Vikings, claiming the events to be \"a Viking-sized adventure.\""}

He then summons his own troops to attack Patrick. Patrick retreats into his castle and returns with a cannon, in which he attacks SpongeBob's hit squad. The hit squad retreats, and SpongeBob manages to get them safely back inside his own fortress. It is in vain, however, as the cannonball finds its way over the fortress wall and smashes them.\nSpongeBob, in retaliation, builds a tank to destroy Patrick's fortress, while Patrick comes with a giant robot. The tank and the robot clash, and the robot gains the upper-hand by picking up SpongeBob's tank. As it prepares to crush the tank, SpongeBob fires the tank's cannon monsters and destroys Patrick's robot. He for the next moment thinks he is victorious, but Patrick returns on the robot's head, which has separated from the body and is now an airship.\nSpongeBob pulls out a remote control and pushes a button on it, calling in a fighter jet which he hops into the cockpit and takes control of. As Patrick tries to run, SpongeBob has two missiles from the fire jet chase him. Civilians on the beach begin to flee in terror. Patrick deploys a surface to air missile launcher from underneath the ground. He has it fire its eight loaded missiles at SpongeBob, destroying the two missiles that were chasing Patrick in the process. SpongeBob takes evasive maneuvers and manages to get them to fly into Patrick's fortress, completely destroying it. Patrick in a final act of retaliation uses his airship to blow up SpongeBob's fortress. SpongeBob is extremely enraged by this, and putting all sensible options aside, he flies his fighter jet into Patrick's robot head airship, destroying both aircrafts and hurting Patrick and himself.\nSpongeBob and Patrick are lying wounded on the beach, apologizing to each other for trying to destroy the other. The life guard shows up and furiously points out the mess of debris and destruction left by the fight as the two see they went too far. The lifeguard demands they clean up after handing them brooms. They do as he says, tidying the beach up to its original condition, but soon begin to compete with each other over who could do so faster as dusk approaches."}
{"prompt": "Shell Shocked", "completion": "In the middle of the night, SpongeBob is having a nightmare while chattering his teeth. After SpongeBob wakes up from the nightmare, he hears a noise down in his kitchen. SpongeBob is frightened about the noise. He tries to call for help, and realizes that his telephone line is cut, and later puts on his army helmet and grabs his tennis racket. His knees are shaking as he runs to open up the door, and slides down to the library. SpongeBob later trips on his toy truck, and falls down the steps. He runs into his kitchen and finds his novelty teeth chattering. He finds his fancy boot hopping around and smacks the boot with his tennis racket which leads him to smack his face. SpongeBob drops his tennis racket and karate-chops the boot, unaware that Gary is hiding in his fancy boot. Gary comes crashing out of the boot, and spins around, while a bucket and soap come down on Gary. When SpongeBob takes the bucket off of Gary, he finds that Gary has soap in his mouth, and manages to take it out now hearing Gary's gasps. SpongeBob thinks for a minute that Gary is not hurt, and then touches Gary's shell, as it breaks.\nSpongeBob apologizes to Gary. Gary meows, smells his own stink, feels pain, and begins to cry. SpongeBob grabs Gary and tries to hug him, but Gary refuses and goes up to the ceiling in more pain. Later, SpongeBob tries to find out how to fix Gary's shell, first by taping it back together, although it breaks once again.\nIn the bedroom, where SpongeBob goes through his trunk to find solutions for Gary, he first finds his Hawaiian shirt, but realizes it does not work. He then finds his Christmas Santa hat, but realizes that it is too last season, and later finds his gorilla mask that he needs for Halloween. SpongeBob first finds his copy of his pants, and tries them on Gary, but they get wet and drop. Next, SpongeBob finds his space helmet by trying it on his head, and then Gary but realizes it does not look right. SpongeBob later finds his race car helmet, and puts it on Gary now realizing that Gary rocks. Gary throws it off and shows him a Shell Spiffy magazine, which is a magazine full of snail shells. Gary meows at SpongeBob to take a look at page 72, which features his old shell with many new features, and the cost is $9,595.95. SpongeBob wonders where he can get a high quality shell without spending a fortune. Gary knows where to get a shell very cheap, and shows SpongeBob a commercial which now features Scooter cleaning up his snail's broken shell, which is for Angry Jack's Shell Emporium, where the prices are always very cheap. Angry Jack introduces himself through the television, and advertises a commercial full of shells which include a refurbished plastic shell, and gets angry with the numbers in his face, along with the other shells.\nAngry Jack starts talking about selling for real. When SpongeBob and Gary get to the Shell Emporium, they interrupt Angry Jack in the commercial. SpongeBob apologizes to Angry Jack, thinking that he is going to get angry. Angry Jack reveals that he just does it for the commercial to make them loud and better. Jack then finds a shell that looks exactly like Gary's old one, and tries it on Gary, which makes him very happy. SpongeBob thinks it is perfect, and wants to buy it for Gary because it looks like his old one. The shell then slides off of Gary and breaks, which makes him depressed once again. Jack then decides to try a different shell on Gary. SpongeBob wants to take it, and decides to make sure that it is put down by pushing down on it harder. He manages to break it, which makes Gary mad at him again. He manages to grab another shell, but accidentally breaks it over Jack's face. SpongeBob manages to grab another shell off of the shelf, but trips over his shoe laces, causing it to break. Jack hands over Gary to SpongeBob in order to take care of the shells, and tries on the reflective model on Gary. The reflection blinds both SpongeBob and Gary. After being almost blind, SpongeBob accidentally starts to break all of the shells in the store. Jack gives SpongeBob one more shell which is proven indestructible. SpongeBob makes sure that his hand and shoes are perfect, and wraps them up in bubble wrap and tape, but the shell manages to slip through the bubble wrap, and breaks.\nSpongeBob mentions about reducing inventory, which makes Jack angry for real, and demands immediate payment. SpongeBob hands Jack some quarters, and Jack demands one arm and legs, also a heart and one eyeball, and his pants.\nLater, SpongeBob is walking while carrying Gary, wishing that his shell would grow back, and then finds a square cardboard box in front of a dumpster, he draws on it, and it becomes Gary's replacement shell. Unfortunately, Gary is more depressed and he and SpongeBob both break down in tears. Mr. Krabs comes out from the dumpster and SpongeBob immediately has an idea. SpongeBob wants Mr. Krabs to help him find a new shell for Gary. Mr. Krabs manages to shake SpongeBob upside down to find some money to help Gary get a new shell. Mr. Krabs starts to walk away as SpongeBob manages to make a deal to work for free for the rest of the year. Mr. Krabs decides that he wants to cut SpongeBob's health insurance and SpongeBob makes the deal.\nThat night at SpongeBob's house, he has another nightmare while his teeth are chattering once again. He turns on his flashlight and sees Mr. Krabs' shell on Gary. However, he sees Mr. Krabs coming in through the window very cold, and wants to borrow a blanket.

Plankton thinks they want to eat there, but they were parked there because they could not find parking at the Krusty Krab. Karen then suggests that Plankton should advertise his product. Plankton then hangs a sign that reads \"CHUM IS METABOLIC FUEL!\" Patrick comes along and tries to read the sign, but his head starts smoking from the strain of trying to understand what these new words are. After his head is put out by a cup of kelp juice, Patrick then rearranges the letters, so the sign reads \"CHUM IS FUM!\" The new slogan starts to attract customers. Plankton hires Patrick as his slogan manager.\nMeanwhile, back at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs believes Plankton has stolen the secret formula, so he comes up with a plan to steal the recipe back. Plankton sees through SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs' disguise, and they realize that it was the slogan that brought in the customers, despite the fact the chum tastes awful. To combat the disgusting taste of the chum, the customers simply say \"Chum is Fum\" over and over. Then Plankton goes to Patrick to check on how his assignment to come up with new slogan ideas is going. However, all Patrick does is write Chum is Fum in a thousand different ways. Plankton then gets mad at Patrick but cools down because Patrick's slogan is still attracting customers.\nA few days later, people are getting bored with the slogan, so Plankton and Patrick hold a board meeting. Patrick comes up with a new motto three days later, changing it to \"FUM IS CHUM\". This new slogan brings back Plankton's customers, much to the chagrin of Mr. Krabs. Business is so large that Plankton gets into the restaurant magazines and even a hockey team shows up to eat.\nPatrick then decides to resign from his position as advertising director because he is \"burnt out\" - there is a hole burned into the back of his head. Plankton protests, but then bluffs to make Patrick believe that he is disposable, and not necessary to keep customers eating at the Chum Bucket. During his rant, Plankton accidentally insults his customers over the intercom that he had installed by the cash register earlier to taunt Mr. Krabs. His customers hear him calling them \"buffoons, morons, the dumbest of the dumb\" among other things, which causes all of his customers to abandon their chum in anger. Plankton then gets beaten up by the hockey team. In the end, everybody sees Patrick finishing a sign with the Krusty Krab's new slogan, \"Krabby Patties are fum!\" and everybody returns to the Krusty Krab."}

He sniffs like a dog and soon runs into Plankton. He tells SpongeBob the news, and SpongeBob yells to all of Bikini Bottom that there is a \"Love Emergency.\" SpongeBob then tells Plankton that his present has to come from the heart, and he suggests a serenade. Plankton then remarks that he cannot sing, and SpongeBob takes him to the pineapple and works on Plankton's vocal cords. Plankton sings so high that he breaks the glass Squidward was drinking out of his juice and Sandy's helmet breaks while she was walking, then she runs back to her treedome for air. Then, Plankton goes off to serenade Karen.\nPlankton walks into the Chum Bucket and starts singing a mariachi-style song, and SpongeBob and Patrick play guitars in the background, wearing Mexican-style clothing and mustaches. Plankton also shakes maracas. Karen cries when it is over, and then she starts uploading the Krabby Patty secret formula. SpongeBob is mad at this, so he unplugs what he thinks is Karen, but was just the coffee maker. Karen finally uploads the formula, but she starts crying again, and she breaks down and shorts out, leaving Plankton still without the secret formula, making him confused.

He then sets out to find SpongeBob, and rides his boat to Bikini Atoll.\nThe animated section of the episode then begins with SpongeBob waking up in the morning with the help of many alarm clocks lined up to the foghorn clock, only to blow out more clocks, thus waking SpongeBob up. He then reveals that it is the eleventy-seventh year anniversary since Mr. Krabs officially opened the Krusty Krab. He then remembered the first time he ate a Krabby Patty, and he apparently loved it, even though he was not born yet when he had it. He prepares himself by getting ready in various wacky ways. While we see SpongeBob's getting ready process, the song \"A Day Like This\" can be heard. After he finishes getting ready, SpongeBob rushes all the way to the Krusty Krab when he bumps into the customers waiting in line to get into the restaurant, and he knows that he cannot be late for this, so he jumps over the crowd's heads.\nAs the act ends, SpongeBob arrives at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs reminds them to keep a close eye on all of the doors, and entrances, including the air vents, to make sure that Plankton does not sneak in during the eleventy-seventh year anniversary celebration. Meanwhile, at the Chum Bucket, Plankton spoke with his computer wife, Karen, about how he has been a failure for 50 years of business, while Mr. Krabs has been nothing but successful. In order to redeem himself and finally get his hands on the Krabby Patty secret formula, Plankton decides that he'll sneak into the Krusty Krab while the employees and Mr. Krabs are distracted by the festivities, and steal the formula. \nBack at the live action segments, after Patchy ran off, P!nk and many other celebrities are sat down waiting around for their turn to perform in the extravaganza as promised. P!nk and her band decided it would be a good idea to practice their performance while they wait. They then begin to play the song titled \"We've Got Scurvy\" to open Act 2.\nReturning to Bikini Bottom, Mr. Krabs decides to put SpongeBob in charge of decorating the Krusty Krab. Squidward reminds Mr. Krabs what had happened the other time SpongeBob got to decorate (which then cuts to a flashback of SpongeBob's former decorating failure), but this time he was going to use the resources that he already had in the restaurant including napkins, ketchup, mustard, and inflatable Krabby Patties as balloons. Meanwhile, Patrick had been hired by Mr. Krabs as security. They then went to the freezer to see the ice sculpture SpongeBob had made for the Krabby Patty. After entering the freezer, the door accidentally gets locked behind them, thus trapping them. The four of them decide to bust into the air ducts in an effort to escape.\nWhile in the air ducts, Mr. Krabs finds a wrapper from an older Patty. Mr. Krabs then had a flashback of an old black and white Krusty Krab commercial. SpongeBob and the gang then go into the Krusty Krab surveillance room. On many monitors, they see that SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward's houses were on camera. Mr. Krabs acts as though he doesn't know why there are hidden cameras, although it is heavily referred that he is responsible for them. At that very moment, it's revealed that there are two men recording them from behind as they appear on one of the monitors. Mr. Krabs then suggests that they split up to find a way out. Mr. Krabs goes it alone while the other three stick together. Ultimately they just end up all together again a few moments later. Meanwhile, Plankton had reached the Krusty and was searching through the air ducts to find a way to the formula, but he was having no such luck. Plankton eventually falls right into the duct the gang is in as Act 2 ends there.\nAct 3 starts off back on the surface, where Patchy sails through the sewers and on to the ocean. After sailing for a while he almost makes it to Bikini Bottom but is stopped short and eaten by a whale.\nBack with the gang, SpongeBob remembers the time that Mr. Krabs had first told him the formula. Plankton leans in, in an attempt to find out what the formula is but the Mr. Krabs in the flashback grabs Plankton and throws him down an air duct. After moving further through the air ducts, Squidward remembers the days before SpongeBob lived in Bikini Bottom, but SpongeBob interrupts him to remind him how great it was when he first moved in. Mr. Krabs' wallet then begins going crazy over all of the loose change he isn't earning from the customers waiting in line outside, so Mr. Krabs lets the wallet go so it can get to the money, only to be picked up by an unsuspecting man. Patrick then pulls out a radio transmitter he had taken from Sandy. They then attempt to call Sandy and have her come rescue them but Patrick destroys the transmitter after he thinks that Sandy is trapped inside it. As SpongeBob then remembers the time that he and Sandy got married through a flash-back, only for it to be revealed that the whole thing was just a play.\nAct 4 opens up by showing Patchy, now stuck in the belly of a whale, where he plays some supposed scenes of SpongeBob before it had first aired, including the Squidward, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs theme songs. His camera suddenly goes haywire which results in the whale sneezing him out, and launching him right back into the studio. He is knocked unconscious and starts dreaming that he is in Bikini Bottom by SpongeBob's Pineapple where he meets the titular sponge himself. He was then knocked out again, this time in his dream. He then wakes up to see the celebrities in the studio who tell him he can see SpongeBob everywhere, and they proceed to knock him unconscious once again (but in a rather fascinated way).\nReturning to the gang, at this point, SpongeBob had decided to use all of the gang as a battering ram to break through the air duct. After several tries the gang bust through only to discover that all of the customers were gone due to them waiting so long without getting any food. Mr. Krabs becomes heartbroken and believes the anniversary to be ruined, however, SpongeBob begins to sing the Krusty Krab song, \"Oh, Krusty Krab,\" which brings all of the customers back as they form a circle and start singing with SpongeBob. The Krusty Krab then returns to business and the celebration is ready to begin.\nMr. Krabs also goes after the customer who had taken his wallet. Meanwhile, Plankton, on the other hand, was discovered by Mr. Krabs and was blown into a balloon after he pleads with him not to launch him. Mr. Krabs then holds the door open for a customer who turns out to be the same one who took his wallet. He then chases after the person after realizing this. SpongeBob ends Act 4 wishing the restaurant a happy eleventy-seventh anniversary.\nDuring the epilogue, the narrator compares Patchy to Blackbeard and says that Patchy is not much of a pirate compared to him. He then says he'll see the kids on the 20th anniversary, 10 years from the episode they'd just seen, which is the time between this and \"SpongeBob's Big Birthday Blowout.\"\nAt the end credits, during the celebration for the eleventy seventh anniversary, Squidward sings a parody of \"Beautiful Dreamer\" to close the episode."}

In his office, Mr. Krabs trips on a loose floorboard. He uncovers it to reveal the Krabby Patty secret formula. Mr. Krabs takes a hammer and nails the floorboard back down.\nThe camera zooms out to show that Plankton is watching from his enormous telescope that goes out the Chum Bucket and into the Krusty Krab through the chimney.

However, he crashes into a big rock, and when he digs deeper to go around it, he gets trapped in an underground cave. Plankton discovers it is beautiful and Karen comes up with a plan on how he could get more customers: he could lure them underground by the gorgeous scenery of the cave. In obvious fashion of Plankton, he ignores Karen before stealing her idea, to her annoyance. At that moment, Cave Dwellers appear, but Plankton tames them with his whip, making them his new employees.\nLater that day, Mr. Krabs discovers that Plankton has more customers by his cave and decides to go down there to sell Krabby Patties.

He begins to explain that he is stuck in his wringer, but Patrick interrupts before he can finish, saying he knows how to help SpongeBob. However, the problem only gets worse when Patrick uses Forever Glue to permanently trap SpongeBob inside it, thinking he is helping him when in reality, he is only making things much worse.\nSpongeBob is a bit upset, but attempts to live his life as normally as possible. Unfortunately, being stuck in the wringer causes some unforeseen problems. SpongeBob causes chaos at the Krusty Krab and Mr. Krabs doesn't allow SpongeBob to come back to work until the destructive device of his is gone because Mr. Krabs' money is in danger. Patrick meets SpongeBob outside and asks how his day is going. SpongeBob admits that he is having some trouble, so Patrick decides to take him to Super Weenie Hut Jr's for some ice cream to cheer him up. SpongeBob becomes even sadder when he discovers that the wringer has closed onto his esophagus, preventing his digestive system from consuming the ice cream.\nPatrick suggests that they go to the carnival. Carnival games prove impossible for SpongeBob, but Patrick has lots of fun. Patrick's good luck annoys SpongeBob, which finally causes him to lose his temper and shout at Patrick for ruining his life, stating that he would not be stuck in the wringer had it not been for the Forever Glue. Patrick admits he was only trying to help, but SpongeBob furiously lashes out at him for his stupidity, which makes Patrick run off crying as a result. The other fish at the carnival look at SpongeBob in anger, forming a silent angry mob, and Sandals selfishly tells him that he deserved what he got. As Sandals and the angry mob walk away from SpongeBob, he frowns into shame.\nThe next morning, Patrick tries to ignore the fact that all of the things he usually does involve SpongeBob, and keeps telling himself that he is not supposed to care about him anymore. Patrick finds that forgetting about his best friend is impossible and enters SpongeBob's house. Inside, he finds a depressed and slightly crazed SpongeBob watching TV static. Horrified by this, and blaming himself for SpongeBob's problem, Patrick cries. His tears splash onto the glue and melt some of it. Upon realizing this, SpongeBob suggests that they both cry so he might be able to slip out of the wringer.\nBoth of them proceed to do so, which melts the glue and allows SpongeBob to be free of the wringer. SpongeBob and Patrick hug when the former tosses the wringer into the air. When it comes back down, it lands around the two, leaving them stuck in the wringer together. This causes another conflict, but SpongeBob does not worry because he is at least stuck with his best friend. The episode ends with Patrick asking if he should use the Forever Glue again."}
{"prompt": "Someone's in the Kitchen with Sandy", "completion": "The episode starts off at the Krusty Krab's kitchen, Plankton hides in one of the sesame seeds of a bun, attempting once again to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. SpongeBob takes the bun Plankton is hiding in and makes a Krabby Patty with it, which he delivers to Sandy's table. Sandy partly unzips her suit and slips the patty into it. Then, Plankton jumps out of the sesame seed just before Sandy takes a bite. He faints shortly after since there is no water in Sandy's air helmet.\nLater, Sandy returns to her treedome. She goes into her bathroom, where she takes off her diving suit and glass helmet. Then, she gets in the shower, turns it on, and rips off her fur coat and bikini. Sandy is almost completely bald and pink, and is wearing a purple set of bra and panties in the shower. She picks up her fur coat, sniffs it, and hangs it on a hook before resuming her shower.\nDrops of water from the shower fall into her helmet, thereby reviving Plankton. Then, Plankton notices Sandy's pelt hanging on the hook. He takes it, locks Sandy in her bathroom, and brings Sandy's fur coat to the Chum Bucket. He motorizes the fur coat and moves it to the Krusty Krab, pretending to be Sandy. SpongeBob is happy to see \"Sandy\" again, but notices that \"she's\" not wearing her diving suit and oxygen helmet. \"Sandy\" replies that he can breathe underwater now. SpongeBob believes \"her,\" of course. Plankton asks SpongeBob for Krabby Patty tips or information.\nAfter some short tips from SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs walks in through the door at the corner of the kitchen and declares that he is leaving the formula out in plain sight by setting it down on a table. Plankton cheers happily in Sandy's fur coat, since stealing the formula is now much easier.\nMeanwhile, Sandy finishes her shower. She wraps a towel around her body and walks over to dry her \"stinky fur coat.\" However, her fur is gone. Finding herself locked in, she breaks down the door of the bathroom, fully aware that someone must have stolen it. She then flings the towel off herself, puts a coffee pot on her head in place of her helmet, and runs off to find the culprit, who's possibly wanting to sell her pelt on the Bikini Bottom black market. However, the Bikini Bottom residences think she is naked, and make fun of her hairless pink skin, calling her a \"hairless goat,\" a \"nudist ferret,\" and a \"naked chipmunk.\" Sandy makes a makeshift skirt out of seaweed to cover her \"hind end,\" but it overheats, gets brittle, and shatters into pieces when she warms her hairless body by a vent.\nAt the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is giving Plankton an irritating lesson where he has to put the bun on the exact spot of the patty, but he is always off by a random amount. He gives up, steals the formula, and tries to escape. The real Sandy enters the Krusty Krab and stops him in the nick of time. She then rolls up her fur coat and puts Plankton in a jar of mustard. Unfortunately, the police catch up with her. When they announce that they will take the \"sicko\" away, Sandy thinks that they are trying to arrest Plankton for stealing her fur coat, but instead they arrest her for public nudity, making her sigh gloomily as the episode comes to an end."}
{"prompt": "The Inside Job", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, Plankton tries to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula, with Karen launching him into Mr. Krabs' brain, but ends up going into SpongeBob's brain instead. Karen and Plankton did not know SpongeBob was holding a cardboard cutout of Mr. Krabs until he moved it away.\nPlankton goes into the optical system to see how to make Krabby Patties, but SpongeBob cannot see because of Plankton and uses inedible cleaning utensils as ingredients. Plankton does not realize this until he decides to go the audio system to listen to the formula, restoring SpongeBob's sight. SpongeBob is horrified at his inedible creation and thinks he forgot to make the Krabby Patty, so he asks Mr. Krabs to tell him the secret recipe again, but by the time he gets in front of him, Plankton is already using SpongeBob's eardrums. SpongeBob cannot hear Mr. Krabs, so the latter repeats himself by yelling, then by using a megaphone. This blasts Plankton away and SpongeBob regains his hearing with him and Mr. Krabs forgetting the reason for his visit.\nPlankton then tries to go to the \"command central\", the brain, to learn about the formula. When he goes inside, he is in SpongeBob's pineapple but it is spaghetti-ish and pinkish, so he goes into the library. He looks at SpongeBob's secrets and finds that the formula is in the heart. He slides the vertebrae down there, and when he sucks information from SpongeBob's heart turns into a clone of him, from appearance to personality, while maintaining his own voice and single eye (now blue like SpongeBob's).\nKaren then calls him asking him if he got the Krabby Patty recipe yet, to which Plankton knows but, now having SpongeBob's personality, refuses to share it as that would be stealing. Karen then turns his mind-reading hat into a propeller to fly Plankton out of SpongeBob and back home.\nOn the way home Plankton bumps into Patrick, latching onto his skull and accidentally sucking information from him, immediately transforming into a Patrick clone. Karen plucks Plankton off of Patrick while he's walking by the Chum Bucket and asks for the recipe but Plankton, now stupid as Patrick, is unable to tell her, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Greasy Buffoons", "completion": "While delivering an order to a customer, SpongeBob slips in a puddle of grease on the floor. Upon further inspection, he, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward see that the restaurant's grease trap is full and deduce that it probably has not been cleaned in quite some time. Mr. Krabs notes that he needs two employees to clean it for no extra pay, and Squidward camouflages himself into thin air, leaving SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs to do the job. That night, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs siphon the grease from the trap into a tanker truck and take it to be \"disposed of\" by illegally dumping it behind the Chum Bucket. SpongeBob questions whether it is legal to dump all the grease behind the Chum Bucket, but as Mr. Krabs has no qualms about performing an illegal activity and the owner of the Chum Bucket, Plankton, is his worst enemy, he tells SpongeBob not to worry.\nThe next morning, Plankton slips on the grease while taking out the trash, confused as to how it got there. It smells horrible, but upon tasting it, he finds it delicious. He takes advantage of the situation by putting it into his Chummy Patties. Later that day, Mr. Krabs sees that Plankton has a whole line of customers outside his restaurant, which is very unusual, but then he spots a sign that reads the Chum Bucket is now serving \"Chummy Patties with edible flavor,\" which is Chummy Patties soaked in Krusty Krab grease. He goes to question Plankton about it, who says that he had a visit from the \"flavor fairy.\"\nRealizing that it was the grease that he dumped that gave Plankton's chum its flavor, Mr. Krabs instructs SpongeBob to cook two patties for everyone who ordered, using the grease from the second to fry the first. SpongeBob thinks that it is unhealthy, but does as he is told. Mr. Krabs promotes this as a \"Deluxe Krabby Patty,\" which attracts Plankton's customers towards the Krusty Krab. Plankton figures out that it was Mr. Krabs that dumped the grease, so he creates \"New Chummy Patties packed with Quadruple Grilled Goodness,\" which steals Mr. Krabs' customers again. Everyone is becoming very unhealthy from eating greasy patties, but they cannot stop eating them. Mr. Krabs makes SpongeBob put even more grease in the patties, and after slipping in some grease in which SpongeBob dropped some buns on an hour ago, Mr. Krabs decides to create Krabby Patties with \"Yummy Bunz,\" which are only just patties with their buns soaked in grease. In response, Plankton creates \"Crispity Crunchities,\" which are just burnt grease crumbs. Mr. Krabs then creates \"Wow! Soup,\" which (as he explains to Squidward) is just pure grease on a paper plate. When SpongeBob walks out of the kitchen, he realizes that the Krusty Krab, the customers, and the ground outside are covered in grease and the customers are extremely sick. SpongeBob starts to have second thoughts about the greasy foods that Mr. Krabs and Plankton are serving. He ultimately decides that enough is enough when he sees his best friend, Patrick, now obese from all the greasy foods and walking into the restaurant to get some \"Crunchity Munchities.\"\nSpongeBob calls the health inspector, which Mr. Krabs and Plankton fear. When the health inspector arrives and questions what had happened, SpongeBob tries to tell him that Mr. Krabs and Plankton are feeding people grease, but he is cut off by Mr. Krabs and Plankton, who stuffs him in a bin. He then repeatedly says \"They've been feeding people-,\" only to be cut off every time by being knocked on the head with the bin lid by Mr. Krabs and Plankton, getting trapped in the bin after Mr. Krabs and Plankton put the lid on and falling off a cliff after Mr. Krabs and Plankton roll the bin off the cliff, leaving him seriously injured at the bottom of said cliff before weakly telling the health inspector that they have been feeding people grease. The health inspector hears this and admits that he thought the grease's stench was familiar, but he also thought that Plankton and/or Mr. Krabs had not showered in a while. Plankton initially tries blaming the whole thing on Mr. Krabs, but the health inspector punishes both of them by having their restaurants shut down until the grease is cleaned up and properly disposed of.\nAfter Plankton leaves to go clean himself, Mr. Krabs appears defeated since he has no way to soak up the grease, but this gives SpongeBob an idea. When Mr. Krabs wakes up at his restaurant the next day and sees that all the grease is gone, he initially thinks that the whole thing was just a dream—but then SpongeBob appears and assures his boss that it was not a dream. It turns out that SpongeBob soaked up all the grease (and is now much larger in size because of it) and plans on properly disposing of it. After SpongeBob happily announces the Krusty Krab as \"grease free,\" Patrick comes up to him and starts licking him, thinking he is a \"Crunchity Munchity.\" SpongeBob runs away with Patrick behind as the episode comes to an end when Mr. Krabs is getting ideas, as the episode ends."}

Back in Mr. Krabs' office, he is seen letting the \"little guy\" (who is his pet scallop that got too big for the cage) go, and it flies out the window.\nLater, SpongeBob sits at home, depressed when Patrick arrives to borrow his refrigerator because his refrigerator was empty. When he learns of SpongeBob's predicament, Patrick suggests that he do what he does when looking for a job: sit back, watch TV, and chug down a carton of Drinkable Sausage. Gary gives SpongeBob smarter advice by giving attention to a newspaper with job suggestions.\nSpongeBob tries out banking and architecture, but realizes that fry cooking is the only thing he knows how to do. With some encouragement from Patrick, he tries out for a sponge role at a TV station and, despite a complete lack of talent, gets it.\nWhen SpongeBob arrives at work the next day, he thinks he is going to be a big actor, but it turns out the \"acting\" he will be doing is the role of a sponge in a bathroom-cleaning commercial, so he appears as his natural self in order to be the appearance of the New Sponge.\nBefore they get to cleaning the toilet, he quits and returns to the Krusty Krab, begging Mr. Krabs for his old job back. He is lucky enough to get it, under the condition that he also cleans the restaurant's toilets, which he does happily, while Hans is reading a newspaper, sitting on one of the toilets, as the episode ends.\n"}

He then walks over to Squidward, thinking he littered, and asks Squidward about the gum, to which Squidward replies that he just stepped in it. Officer John does not believe him, so he gives him a ticket, sentencing him to community service.\nIt then cuts to Squidward picking up trash, then Squilliam comes along and brags about the statue that was made of him just for cleaning up Bikini Bottom in only one week, which challenges Squidward to try to clean it up in only one day. Squilliam then gets out a tissue and blows his nose on it and drops it on the ground, to make cleaning up more difficult for him. Officer John comes along, sees the tissue, and thinks Squidward dropped it. He then gives Squidward another ticket.\nWhen Squidward looks for a place to put his trash, he sees that all the cans and dumpsters are full, so he \"borrows\" a kid's toy wagon. Mable sees Squidward with the trash and she tells everyone it is Trash Day; soon the trash in the wagon becomes a trash mountain. SpongeBob comes out of one of the garbage bags and offers Squidward to help him when he discovers the life cycle of a Krabby Patty that was thrown out. Then the boy and his mother appear, with the boy telling his mother to beat Squidward to a pulp for stealing his wagon. Squidward is thrashed up and covered in garbage. Officer John thinks Squidward made the mess and gives him another ticket. Squidward then accepts SpongeBob's offer and SpongeBob gets rid of all the trash.\nSquidward goes home and relaxes until he realizes his house is made of garbage. He runs outside and sees that the garbage was made into a replica of his own house.\nOfficer John gives Squidward two tickets, one for the garbage house and one for the first ticket falling on the ground. Squidward gets so angry, his nerves spell out \"I am angry.\" SpongeBob asks why and Squidward finds out his house is on top of the replica because the dump is closed. SpongeBob took it to his house by sucking the garbage onto his body. When SpongeBob talks, garbage comes out of his mouth, leading Officer John to give Squidward another ticket.\nSquidward puts the trash-filled SpongeBob in SpongeBob's own bin, which gives Squidward another ticket for putting his trash in someone else's garbage bin. SpongeBob finds out that the reason why Squidward wants to get rid of the trash is to get a statue of himself. SpongeBob makes a statue of Squidward made of the garbage.\nSquilliam says the statue is just like Squidward, having the stench of failure. The stench melts Squilliam's statue, ruining it, and Squilliam unexpectedly gets a ticket from Officer John.

SpongeBob tells him that he does not have time to give him one and sadly walks away to work, feeling remorseful that he had no time to hang out with Gary. As he goes to the Krusty Krab, he notices that Mr. Krabs refuses to give one customer service on account of him bringing his pet worm into the restaurant. This reminds SpongeBob of the fact that Gary is home alone with nobody to keep him company, prompting him to make a remorseful phone call reminding Gary that he will arrive home soon.\nAs SpongeBob gets off work at night, Mr. Krabs tells him that he needs help with loading coal out of the parking lot, but SpongeBob cannot help as he has to get back to Gary at home. Mr. Krabs lets him off the hook so long as he comes in work five hours earlier the following day to help with the parking lot. As SpongeBob is walking home, he notices a truck selling nudibranchs, which catch his attention due to their \"cute\" appearance. However, the lady selling them informs him of their danger (they are extremely vicious and hostile toward other pets, especially snails), but SpongeBob does not pay attention and simply runs off with a green nudibranch without paying for it, the lady commenting aside that nobody listens to her.\nSpongeBob comes home and shows Gary his new playmate while he is at work; he names it \"Puffy Fluffy,\" and places them next to one another to have them get along as he makes an enchiladas meal. Anytime SpongeBob is not present, Puffy makes blatant threats to Gary, but SpongeBob fails to notice the nudibranch's impending danger and instead accuses Gary of perpetrating violence against him or ignoring him. As punishment, Gary is put to sleep early tonight, next to Puffy Fluffy, then SpongeBob himself goes upstairs to sleep, berating Gary again when he disturbs him. Over the night, Puffy continues to threaten Gary as if he is going to kill him. Gary tries many defense mechanisms, but it turns out that Puffy Fluffy is stronger than him, making Gary more vulnerable to his abuse. They continue fighting throughout the night which eventually carries into the library, prompting a house fire made by Puffy Fluffy, who knocked over SpongeBob's fireplace, and SpongeBob does not wake up once.\nThe next day, SpongeBob wakes up to find that his house is a mess, and assumes that Gary caused it out of jealousy of his new \"friend.\" He then walks into his exercise room to find Puffy Fluffy about to eat Gary alive, but, oblivious to the nudibranch's blatant abuse, once again accuses Gary of harassing him.\nPuffy eventually traps SpongeBob as well, which gives Gary the idea to save him by getting out his lasso and freeing SpongeBob and intimidating Puffy, who runs off after Gary presents his defense. Despite this, SpongeBob still believes that Gary was responsible for Puffy Fluffy's violent behavior.\nThe episode ends with SpongeBob at work again, this time bringing Gary after the policy has been updated to allow animals in the restaurant so he won't be lonely anymore to his dismay.

As the episode ends, the Krusty Krab begins shaking, and the electric eel pops up from underground scaring away all of the Krusty Krab's customers."}
{"prompt": "The Main Drain", "completion": "The episode begins on one day in Bikini Bottom, after SpongeBob comes out of the freezer with a patty, he  wipes the grill with a sponge (made from part of his own tongue) at the Krusty Krab. He proclaims that it is freshly clean and tries to convince a customer to eat a Krabby Patty that was on the grill. When SpongeBob goes back inside to cook the patty, the customer asks Squidward why he does not want a Krabby Patty, and he replies that he has seen what SpongeBob cleans the grill with. It goes back to SpongeBob, who is on his way to the freezer for a patty when he slips on a puddle of water. Upon closer inspection, SpongeBob observes that the puddle is coming from the sink, which is clogged with water. As he is trying to figure out how to unclog the drain, Patrick comes in and slips as well. He helps SpongeBob try to pull the drain plug.\nEventually, Mr. Krabs overhears them trying to pull the drain plug and stops them before they have a chance. He tells them the story of the Main Drain. He tells them that there was a plug that two kids apparently pulled long ago that ended the world of Bikini Bottom. When they ask him where it is, he becomes nervous and tells them to go away. The two go outside and SpongeBob accidentally steps on Plankton. He peels him off his shoe and then they ask him about it. He becomes nervous as well and tells them to go away. SpongeBob says that he heard it from Mr. Krabs, and Plankton claims Mr. Krabs was lying. They ask him where it is they once again do not get the answer. They turn to Old Man Jenkins, but he yields no results.\nThey then go on an adventure to find the plug by dragging Patrick's house around. Just before they pull the plug, Mr. Krabs and Plankton stop them and tell the story of how they were the ones that pulled the plug when they were younger. They explain that they lied because they did not want SpongeBob and Patrick to look for it. Unfortunately, Patrick had already pulled the plug when they were telling the story and everything (including themselves and the Bikini Bottomites) is sucked into the drain.\nPatrick then sits up in his bed, telling SpongeBob that everything was \"the most realistic story he has ever heard,\" indicating everything that happened was only part of the story that SpongeBob was reading. However, the pulling sound is heard, meaning the drain is likely going to suck the ocean for real, as the episode concludes."}

The plan is for SpongeBob to take one side and Patrick then takes the other. However, as both approach the jellyfish, they end up colliding, letting the jellyfish escape.\nThey continue chasing the jellyfish. They do not watch where they are going and accidentally fall off a cliff, falling way down to a county-like village and landing on a port-a-potty. Many of the trenchbillies gang up on SpongeBob and Patrick and capture them with a rope. They take them to Ma Angler, who says that they are \"awful purdy.\" Ma Angler orders them to an initiation. SpongeBob and Patrick question them and Ma Angler sentences them to a series of challenges, being: a banjo contest, a \"hootin' and hollerin'\" contest, and a wrestling match. SpongeBob and Patrick win the first two competitions but decline to the wrestling match, claiming that they do not like to wrestle.\nMa Angler is surprised and asks them what they like to do for fun. SpongeBob claims that they like to play jellyfishing. They show the trenchbillies how to jellyfish and collide, once again. Ma Angler enjoys this. The trenchbillies laugh at them and call them dumb. Ma Angler certifies them as official honorary trenchbillies and gives the pair sets of novelty teeth.\nSpongeBob gives a short speech before he and Patrick attempt to leave, however, they are stopped by a group of trenchbillies. Cletus Junior of the trenchbillies says that they have to take care of Ma Angler for the rest of their lives. SpongeBob and Patrick try to convince them to let them leave but the trenchbillies will not let them. As a result, Patrick stalls them long enough for him and SpongeBob to escape.\nMeanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs and Squidward lightly chat about business and then SpongeBob and Patrick burst through the door. They tell the pair of what occurred but Mr. Krabs is unconcerned until they reveal that the trenchbillies followed them. The trenchbillies destroy the restaurant out of anger. Mr. Krabs nervously asks them for their orders. They all order something to eat. Mr. Krabs says that Ma Angler, who is eating a lot of Krabby Patties, will make Customer of the Week. One of the trenchbillies sees Mr. Krabs making \"goo-goo eyes at the Ma Angler\" and as the episode ends, Mr. Krabs is forced to get \"hitched\" (married) to Ma Angler."}

After Squidward tells SpongeBob to stop, he slips on some spilled paintbrushes, falls down the stairs and through the floor, breaks a plumage pipe, resulting in spewing water.\nWhen SpongeBob offers to help, Squidward denies that he needs help and tells SpongeBob not to help him ever again. He tightens the pipe so much that the water can't get through. Squidward then walks off grumpily as he's late for work.\nAt the Krusty Krab, Squidward rudely yells \"Pardon me!\" to a purple fish while entering, then walks to the counter and tells SpongeBob to stop staring at him. Squidward scolds everyone that he says he doesn't have time to count pennies when a fish tries to pay for a Krabby Patty with a huge pile of them, comments at a blue fish eating a Krabby Patty tapping his foot on the floor, gets mad with Nat Peterson for holding the door and leaving fingerprints, thinks people are leaving \"trash\" on the tables, insults a frail woman's clattering dentures, and a red fish's tall hat. He even scolds a blue fish for taking too long to eat and another for taking too long in the bathroom. When SpongeBob passes by still singing about his attitude of gratitude, Squidward scolds him to stop. SpongeBob asks whether he has an \"attitude of gratitude,\" but Squidward says that he is the most miserable person (which means the rudest person) in Bikini Bottom due to the fact that he hates his job and neighbors, and doubts it can get worse. Immediately afterwards, a previously dormant volcano erupts. Everybody in the Krusty Krab evacuates because it is falling to pieces. Mr. Krabs sees no point in trying to run away and demands Squidward's and SpongeBob's life essence after the cash register is destroyed until someone points out the shelter.\nIn the shelter, the mayor is trying to calm everyone, but they won't stop worrying. When the mayor ultimately thinks that Bikini Bottom is doomed, a mysterious dolphin warrior comes in and says that they must sacrifice the most miserable person. When Squidward goes towards the door, SpongeBob says that they must find the most miserable person, but Squidward mocks him. They then realize Squidward is the most miserable person, so they attempt to sacrifice him. They remind Squidward of what he said and that he even admitted to being the most miserable. Before they throw him into the volcano alive, SpongeBob offers to be thrown in because he made Squidward miserable. Squidward accidentally falls off a ledge and asks SpongeBob for help. When SpongeBob reminds him of his promise, Squidward takes it back and SpongeBob saves him. Meanwhile, the pipe at Squidward's house has built up so much water that it sends the house flying, and it falls into the volcano. The dolphin then says that he was going to say that the most miserable person's house must be sacrificed, and the people are once again calmed; except for Squidward, who now has no roof to sleep under, and is even more miserable. SpongeBob then lets Squidward sleep under his pineapple, as the episode ends."}

Sometime during the ride, the key to the box is stolen and SpongeBob and Patrick must find the thief.\nAfter getting squished a couple of times, Plankton walks up to them, and Patrick searches him but finds him to be clean. The duo stops the train to find the suspect responsible for stealing the key. A nanny and her baby are searched, only to find a stolen jewel in the baby's diaper that was stolen by triplets who pretended to be the nanny and baby. The curtains then close.\nThe curtains reopen and the next suspect, the butler, is then revealed to be a thief named Orin J. Ruffy, who stole $75,000 worth of ham sandwiches. SpongeBob cries hopelessly but soon finds Patrick having the key; in fact, he found it while he cleaned SpongeBob's shorts. They head back into the train and are on their way to the bank. Eventually, Plankton bats them out of a window and the best friends must chase the train. It is revealed that Plankton has the key now.\nAs SpongeBob morphs himself into a hang glider, he and Patrick fly back onto the train to pursue him. Once they return, SpongeBob and Patrick chase Plankton through the caboose, the coaches, the tender, and the engine before Plankton disconnects the coal tender, coaches, and caboose of the train from the engine, leaving SpongeBob and Patrick in the engine's cabin. As the two try to stop the train, Patrick stupidly breaks the brake of the train, causing it to go out of control.\nHe makes several weird, futile attempts to stop the train, one of which is to put a heavy object on the tracks. This only causes the train to flip and move forward while some of the wheels go off the track. The two manage to bring all of the wheels back in place when they stop in front of a retirement home. Patrick then stupidly breaks the throttle, which he thought said \"Break.\" Meanwhile, as Plankton is caught trying to steal the formula by Mr. Krabs, he still escapes with it, until the train crashes into the bank and stops Plankton before he can leave. Even though Plankton's plan fails again, Mr. Krabs has to pay the damage to the bank with his bank account, causing Mr. Krabs to scream in disbelief.\nSeventy-five years later, Elderly SpongeBob finishes the story of the \"Great Train Caper.\" His grandson responds by telling him to keep quiet as he is in excitement over his video game, while SpongeBob remarks about kids these days and goes to sleep, as the episode ends."}

Squidward finally opens up his blinds to look out of his window, and this annoys him because they are running in his yard the whole time. He finally loses his temper and walks outside to confront them. He stops SpongeBob and Patrick with two suction cups and screams at them about playing in his yard. SpongeBob explains to Squidward about doing so, and that they're using his yard as a walkway. Squidward now wants to make them choose which one of their yards to play in, and leave his yard out of the situation. Patrick thinks he's good at choosing, but can't decide which yard to play in that day, and finally lets Squidward choose.\nHe separates SpongeBob and Patrick from each other by putting them in their own yards and draws a box around his to prevent SpongeBob or Patrick from going in it, and then goes inside his own house.\nThe two panic and think that they will never see each other again. SpongeBob tries to walk across the road, but the traffic is terrible, and just at that moment wants Patrick to do something. Patrick tries to squeeze himself into the mailbox in order to get to SpongeBob's house, but the mailbox breaks and explodes. SpongeBob wants Patrick to sit tight, ties himself to the mailbox, and slingshots himself over to Patrick, but it doesn't work. SpongeBob now has an idea and wants Patrick to see so they think to dig a tunnel underneath their houses.\nThey eventually meet up and start playing. Squidward can hear them playing, so he goes outside, but they are not in his yard. He looks in SpongeBob's and Patrick's houses, but they are not there either. He can not find them anywhere and eventually, this sends Squidward into a rage as he believes SpongeBob and Patrick have finally become ghosts, so he shouts \"Where are they?!\" and starts jumping up and down. This causes the roots underground to wiggle, and SpongeBob and Patrick think they are dancing, so they start doing so.\nThis sinks Squidward's house and he finally realizes that they've been underground the whole time, so he enters his house through the roof hatch. Squidward comes out of his house and makes SpongeBob and Patrick dig it back out while he relaxes, but Patrick accidentally breaks Squidward's window and SpongeBob accidentally lets all the dirt flood Squidward and himself out of the house. Squidward threatens SpongeBob and Patrick if they don't obey him and dig out his house by the count of 3, Squidward will turn them into chum (kill them), which frightens them.\nSpongeBob and Patrick dig more, but it was not enough to dig the house out completely, so when Squidward reaches 3, they start running away in panic from Squidward, digging more tunnels. As they are doing this, SpongeBob and Patrick sink all the buildings in Bikini Bottom, including their own houses, downtown, and even the Krusty Krab. Plankton then realizes that the Chum Bucket is the only restaurant in town, but it sinks too.\nAfter a whole lot of digging, SpongeBob and Patrick come to a rock and a furious Squidward corners toward them. After he yells at them and they tearfully apologize before anticipating the inevitable, all of Bikini Bottom sinks underground.\nSometime later, SpongeBob, Squidward, and the other Bikini Bottomites are seen digging out Bikini Bottom.

He puts it on the floor, so Gary is eye-level with it. It attracts flies and one fly goes into SpongeBob's mouth and he begins to choke. Patrick walks in and asks for some cheese before realizing SpongeBob is choking. Once it becomes clear to him, he punches SpongeBob. SpongeBob flies across the room and lands against the wall and the fly leaves his mouth. He offers anything in return and gives Patrick the cheese.\nWhile he's watching SpongeBob practice his karate exercises, Patrick asks his best friend to teach him karate. SpongeBob's a little skeptical but ultimately agrees since that was part of the deal. He tries to teach Patrick the \"reverse whirlpool,\" and then how to fly into a brick wall and destroy it. Patrick succeeds in this but ends up unable to stop flying and destroys a lemonade stand. Next, SpongeBob tries to teach Patrick a move where he spins around on one foot. Patrick then starts spinning uncontrollably. SpongeBob gives up, and Patrick perfectly karate-chops a cinder block in half out of anger. He chops a steel sword and a boat as practice and then almost chops Baby Rechid. SpongeBob stops and warns him not to chop any living organisms or their property. He reminds him that \"with power comes responsibility,\" but has to go to work and leaves Patrick, who starts chopping everything from arcade games to spinach.\nA man runs into the Krusty Krab, screaming that there is a \"mad chopper\" on the loose, and SpongeBob, knowing the man is referring to Patrick, sets off to stop his friend. Meanwhile, Patrick is in an ice-cream shop. He is buying a cone stacked high with every flavor they have. He owes the ice cream man over eighty dollars but tries to trade him for a lollipop. The ice cream man refuses and threatens to call the cops when Patrick chops the glass, cracking it, and tips the ice cream into his mouth while the ice cream man holds onto the money from the tip jar. The manager yells at the ice cream man for holding the money in the tip jar. Patrick gains considerable weight, and no longer fits through the door. He chops it and exits.\nSpongeBob comes and tells Patrick to stop destroying Bikini Bottom, but by that time, Patrick's arm cannot stop chopping. He eventually makes his way to the Barg'N-Mart and destroys the structure and searches for SpongeBob. He finds a pack of kitchen sponges and mistakenly believes this to be SpongeBob's carcass but is told by an angry store clerk, Dennis that isn't SpongeBob and what they really are. Gleeful, Patrick asks if he didn't really crush his friend but the clerk points out the debris crushing SpongeBob. Patrick frees the unconscious SpongeBob and becomes very mad at himself and rips off his own hand. SpongeBob wakes up and Patrick grows his hand back, swearing never to use karate again.\nPatrick then badly rebuilds the Barg'N-Mart. Patrick is then shown karate chopping a shopping cart, leaving SpongeBob irritated since he promised to stop. The real Patrick then appears, and explains that in addition to sea stars being able to regenerate limbs, the limbs that fall off are able to regenerate new bodies. The second Patrick then chops more before he leaves as the Barg'N-Mart gets destroyed again, as the episode ends. "}

Mr. Krabs gets an idea to start a time capsule.\nThe next scene shows the tartar sauce vat next to a hole with a large stage next to it. A huge line of people are in line to make contributions to the time capsule by handing things in, and Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward to handle them while he sells souvenirs. It shows several people making contributions, which Squidward critiques, but SpongeBob finds everything amazing. Mr. Krabs sells cheap souvenirs for outrageous prices. Patrick comes to make a donation of his favorite rock. Believing that this item is too ridiculous for a time capsule, Squidward tries to seize the break from Patrick. The struggle makes the rock fly in the air and it puts the wood behind him, flinging Squidward, SpongeBob, and Patrick into the time capsule, trapping them in and burying them alive. Mr. Krabs puts a copy of the Krabby Patty secret formula in the capsule, making Plankton interested.\nIn the time capsule, the three of them imagine what the future would be like until Squidward gets knocked out. Patrick then finds shaving cream which he mistakes for whipped cream, so he tastes it and finds it awful. Plankton drills into the capsule, hitting the shaving cream that sprays Patrick, which gives him a beard and Patrick sprays SpongeBob and Squidward. Squidward wakes up, thinking it has been 50 years due to the beard, and escapes through the hole Plankton created. The \"future\" is not what Squidward wanted, so he goes back to the time capsule, unknowingly stepping on the formula bottle on his way back, shoving it inside Plankton.\nThe episode ends with Plankton at the Chum Bucket constipated with his body shaped like a bottle and him sitting on a toilet, trying to get the formula out of his body.

Say, do you mind if I cut in front of you?\" SpongeBob tries to say no, but he ends up letting the fish cut him anyways, making him behind the other fish. Then a lot of fish come and cut in front of him. Patrick comes and asks SpongeBob why he is not first (like he promised). SpongeBob says he's sorry but they'll still be able to catch the first bus. Patrick, now no longer mad at SpongeBob for breaking his promise, becomes happy, and the bus comes, so they run to it.\nThey almost get in the bus, but then Sandy comes and asks SpongeBob for him to do \"Operation: Acorn Smoothie.\" SpongeBob says no but after a guilt trip from Sandy, he unhappily agrees.

After the situation with Sandy, he goes back to the bus stop, then Mr. Krabs asks SpongeBob to say no to Pearl about the new shoes that she desperately wants.\nAfterwards, he goes back to the bus stop and his Grandma asks him to help her cross the road. SpongeBob, as usual, says no but then his guilt trips into helping anyways. Patrick returns and is mad at SpongeBob for making him go to Glove World! by himself. SpongeBob says he's sorry but people kept asking him to do things. Patrick tells SpongeBob that sometimes he just has to say no, and he needs to grow thicker skin, then it reminds him to ask SpongeBob to scratch his back, which SpongeBob does.\nLater, he is shown at his house crying to Gary about how he can't say no to anything anyone asks him. Gary then goes to a catalog and orders something for SpongeBob, which turns out as an adhesive fabric named \"Abrasive Sponge\" which is an abrasive side designed for doormat sponges to stick on their backs and strengthens their attitudes. SpongeBob feels this is perfect for his situation, so he sticks it on his back, and it begins to insult Gary. SpongeBob is oblivious to this and goes off after saying goodbye to him.\nHe goes out and Pilar asks him to carry his groceries for him. His body rotates and the abrasive face says \"Carry 'em yourself, fishface!\" for SpongeBob. He does the same for Larry who asked him to help him put sun lotion on, Grandma who asked for help crossing the street, and Sandy who asked him to help her with a science invention. However, the abrasive side simply launches nasty insults at them, leaving them baffled, while Sandy's head vanishes when her dropped laser misfires and pierces her helmet. \nHe then goes into the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs asks him to do a seventeen-hour extra shift. SpongeBob says yes, but then his abrasive side rejects the offer unless Mr. Krabs pays him for overtime, Mr. Krabs is confused for he never heard this word before, so he goes into his office and looks it up on a dictionary. When he discovers that it leads to his financial loss, Mr. Krabs is terrified at this disgusting word. He goes home and Squidward sarcastically says \"Oh, fun. I suppose you want me to play some stupid game, or you'll just follow me around all day and never ever leave, huh?\" The abrasive sponge angrily taunts \"'Fraid not, Schnozward! I wouldn't hang out with you for all the money in Krabs' mattress!\" Relieved that SpongeBob did not bother him, Squidward hugs him in tears of joy saying \"You don't know how long I've waited to hear those words.\"\nPatrick says it's time for their play-date. SpongeBob talks but the abrasive side fights himself. Patrick is terrified and promptly leaves. SpongeBob is confused but goes into his house and goes to the bathroom and stares into the mirror, and realizes that it is causing more trouble than good (mainly because it has a mind of its own!). He asks Patrick for help, but the abrasive side scares him away again. SpongeBob then goes to Mr. Krabs for help, who is still cowering at the word overtime. The abrasive face takes over and tells Mr. Krabs he wants overtime. Mr. Krabs screams then kicks out SpongeBob for using offensive language. Eventually, SpongeBob makes it to a headless Sandy and pulls a string below her helmet to restore her head.\nAfter hearing SpongeBob's explanation, Sandy advises him to remove it for good. She pulls it off while he grabs on Patrick, causing him to yell in pain briefly. The abrasive sponge is then packaged and returned to sender.

Afterward, he gets thrown out when he violates their \"No sweatbands rule.\" The large, outdoor Mr. Sea Chicken statue is revealed to be the main attraction of the restaurant which is why everyone is going there rather than the Krusty Krab.\nMr. Krabs decides he needs an artist and lists people after SpongeBob says he knows one until an annoyed Squidward speaks up and he is revealed to be the person SpongeBob knew. Mr. Krabs belatedly recalls Squidward being an artist and asks Squidward to make a statue of him. Mr. Krabs makes various poses and Squidward keeps saying no until Mr. Krabs holds his arms in the air, and Squidward finds the perfect pose.\nIt takes Squidward almost one day to finish making the statue. He has Mr. Krabs stand in one position with his hands up in the air for all that time, but Mr. Krabs isn't pleased when the statue is finished. The final result expresses what Squidward may actually feel about Mr. Krabs, as it has spikes and a second mouth near the stomach area. SpongeBob plays on it after Mr. Krabs tells him to make sure it's safe, but it falls on him, which causes an annoyed Squidward to respond with \"This is art! Not a swing set!\" The statue is not as safe as a playground object, and it is revealed that it could result in a lawsuit. SpongeBob then decides to paint Mr. Krabs gold so the children can play on him instead of the statue, with the episode coming to an end once SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that he is \"golden.\""}
{"prompt": "Whelk Attack", "completion": "SpongeBob and Patrick are in Jellyfish Fields when they hear a strange noise. Soon, a stampede of large whelks make their way through Jellyfish Fields, destroying anything in their path. The whelks cover SpongeBob and Patrick in purple goo, which SpongeBob cleans up. As the whelks make their way to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob and Patrick decide to warn the Bikini Bottomites about the whelks, but the whelks are already chasing and terrorizing everyone, blowing purple goo bubbles around their victims and swallowing the bubbles with their victims inside. SpongeBob and Patrick wonder what the whelks are.\nJohnny Elaine explains them on TV, suddenly signing off the news when he is eaten by a sea whelk. Patrick claims that he is not scared of whelks and provokes one by blowing a raspberry at it, causing it to chase him and SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab. When they arrive, they warn Mr. Krabs about the coming danger. Soon after, the whelks make their way to the Krusty Krab, but Mr. Krabs thinks they are just plain old customers.\nA larger mother whelk is then revealed, assisting her \"babies.\" When Mr. Krabs offers them all Krabby Patties, the mother not only dislikes and spits them out but swallows him, along with Squidward and the entire Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Patrick then run to Sandy's treedome, where Sandy only allows them to enter after confirming that they are not whelks. Sandy puts metal armor around the Treedome for protection against the whelks and tells SpongeBob and Patrick her plan to defeat the whelks.\nSuddenly, the whelks crack and destroy the Treedome and SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick are swallowed by the mother whelk. Inside the whelk, Sandy discovers that the whelks are sick. SpongeBob then simply helps the whelk get better again by doing what he did to cure his suds, revealing the whelk's true form, a tiny, helpless whelk. SpongeBob does this to all the whelks and restores the whelks' happy family. All of the \"eaten\" victims are rescued, and the episode ends with Squidward complaining about all that just because the whelks \"had the sniffles,\" then getting doused with purple whelk goo."}
{"prompt": "You Don't Know Sponge", "completion": "At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Patrick are making their favorite noises, while simultaneously annoying Squidward. SpongeBob's is the dolphin laughing and Patrick's is the song of the great blue whale. Squidward, who is extremely annoyed at this point, asks them what was happening. They explain that they are doing stuff together out of a magazine called Simple-Ton. They then take a quiz to find out how much they know about each other and SpongeBob does fantastic. However, Patrick does terribly.\nPatrick buys two ice cream cones (but only gets his favorite flavor, which is dill pickle swirl with mustard and extra bacon bits) and asks SpongeBob for money. SpongeBob becomes upset, and he tells Patrick that he doesn't know him anymore after tearfully throwing the money on the ground. He then runs off to his house, crying. Eventually, SpongeBob goes to Sandy for some advice. She says that SpongeBob and Patrick don't have to know everything about each other and probably just need some time apart.\nSpongeBob then tries to avoid Patrick, but he sees him go to the gym and many other places with Larry. Patrick is shown with a gift when SpongeBob angrily confronts the two, followed with Larry uncomfortably backing away from them. Patrick then explains that Larry is not his best friend and that Larry helped Patrick find a gift for SpongeBob, which is a pair of glasses with a fake nose and mustache.\nSpongeBob and Patrick become friends again until Patrick gets scared by SpongeBob in the glasses and runs away, with SpongeBob quietly sighing \"Why me?\""}

They see everyone is waiting in line to ride the Tunnel of Glove and they hurry to get in line. SpongeBob and Patrick walk by and SpongeBob greets Pearl, but Pearl angrily asks why is he talking to her. Nancy and Gale ask if SpongeBob is her boyfriend. They also make SpongeBob stand next to Pearl and they take a picture of them \"for posterity.\" Pearl says SpongeBob is not her boyfriend and she and her friends head for the ride. Patrick stays behind to eat cotton candy, so SpongeBob heads off to the Tunnel of Glove without him.\nNancy and Gale get a boat to themselves, but Pearl has to wait because she is a single rider. The ride operator asks for another single rider to come forward, which happens to be SpongeBob. Pearl and SpongeBob get in a boat, but Pearl rudely tells SpongeBob to leave her alone. Pearl finds the Tunnel of Glove boring, and SpongeBob's pointless stories about Mr. Krabs do not help. Pearl tries to exit the ride, but SpongeBob holds her back since they are not supposed to leave the boat. SpongeBob is accidentally launched out of the boat when it rocks and he hits the ceiling, causing the hearts from the ceiling to fall down. One heart gets stuck in the operating gears, leaving SpongeBob and Pearl stuck on the ride.\nThree hours later, Perch Perkins arrives to do a broadcast on the ride. He makes a big deal out of it, saying a \"doomed couple\" is trapped inside. Nancy and Gale, who managed to get off the ride before it broke down, tell Perch that Pearl and her \"boyfriend\" SpongeBob are the couple in there. Patrick, pigging out on food, hears the newscast and, with Perch's encouragement, runs towards the ride to save SpongeBob. Patrick is unsuccessful because the police will not let anyone through the front entrance, so he decides to find another way in. He runs into the Glove World Power Plant and mistakes an electrical generator for SpongeBob due to the fact the generator is shaped like him. Thinking that SpongeBob is chained to the wall, Patrick pulls the generator off of it and causes the electricity to go out on the ride. SpongeBob freaks out and tells Pearl about all the creepy creatures in the dark (mostly clowns), but Pearl ignores him and leaves the boat to find a way out. SpongeBob follows and continues talking about scary creatures and monsters, scaring Pearl in the process. They get scared by one of the ride's robotic cupids and get back in their boat. Pearl asks SpongeBob to hold her because she is so scared.\nPatrick plays board games with the generator when an electrician appears to fix everything. Patrick angrily accuses him of kidnapping SpongeBob, but the electrician has no idea what he is talking about. Patrick sits down on a lever and breaks it, sending the Tunnel of Glove ride into super-fast mode. SpongeBob and Pearl's boat speeds into the Hall of Romance, which features animatronic figures depicting famous love scenes. Patrick also accidentally pushes a button labeled \"Animatronic Override,\" making the figures' heads explode and go after SpongeBob and Pearl like zombies. Patrick breaks the ride even further by using the water supply room as a restroom and tampering with the extreme water pressure. The water pressure causes SpongeBob, Pearl, and the figures to go down a waterfall and whirlpool and The Tunnel of Glove itself floods and explodes. SpongeBob and Pearl are safe and Pearl admits that the ride was actually pretty fun. Nancy and Gale walk up and think SpongeBob is definitely Pearl's boyfriend because they were hugging, but Pearl once again says they are not dating. A crawly clown robot climbs out of the wreckage and scares SpongeBob (since he told Pearl he is afraid of crawly clowns). He and Pearl's friends cling to each other in fright and Pearl takes a picture of them for revenge. Meanwhile, Patrick shares food with the generator because he still thinks it is SpongeBob."}
{"prompt": "Krusty Dogs", "completion": "After preparing a large batch of Krabby Patties, SpongeBob molds the leftover Krabby Patty meat into a strange shape that resembles a sausage. He calls it the Krusty Dog and Mr. Krabs starts serving it for twice the amount of a Krabby Patty. The Krusty Dogs become so popular that Mr. Krabs eventually decides to remove Krabby Patties from the menu. He even replaces the grill with a hot dog rotisserie machine and renames the Krusty Krab the Krusty Dogs, much to SpongeBob's dismay.\nSpongeBob soon teams up with Squidward to get rid of the Krusty Dogs and bring back the Krabby Patties. Squidward pretends that he is suffering abdominal pain due to the Krusty Dog and SpongeBob gives a speech trying to persuade the customers to go back to eating Krabby Patties, but neither one of these attempts work. In a last-ditch attempt to abolish the Krusty Dogs, SpongeBob stuffs a balloon inside one and quickly pumps air into it after he serves it to a customer. The Krusty Dog explodes in the customer's face and everyone panics, fleeing the scene.\nMr. Krabs decides to bring the Krabby Patties back and Squidward is made to stand outside the restaurant advertising the patties, only to be kicked by a woman who thinks he did not receive good enough education."}
{"prompt": "The Wreck of the Mauna Loa", "completion": "During a game of tag between SpongeBob and Patrick, the duo carelessly falls off a cliff and into an underground cavern, which conceals a large shipwreck called the \"Mauna Loa.\" SpongeBob and Patrick excitedly spend the day playing on and exploring the ship, soon discovering a giant pile of golden coins with the words \"Mauna Loa\" engraved on each inside. Suddenly, SpongeBob checks his watch and realizes that he is late for work, and runs off, leaving Patrick on his own.\nSpongeBob, at the Krusty Krab, distractedly does his work while thinking about the Maura Loa. SpongeBob even creates a Krabby Patty in the shape of a ship, which he ends up throwing away when an impatient Squidward inquires him about his peculiar creation, wanting to keep the ship a secret and dubbing it a \"secret hideout\". Patrick, adding insult to injury, walks into the restaurant wearing a shirt with the words \"Follow Me to the Mauna Loa\" on it. When SpongeBob asks Patrick to make their  hideout less obvious to the public, Patrick only responds by repeatedly chanting \"Secret Hideout!,\" getting the attention of everyone inside. When SpongeBob yells at Patrick to stop, Mr. Krabs bursts through the door and impatiently asks Patrick to leave the kitchen. As SpongeBob ends his shift and walks out with Patrick, Patrick pays for a Krabby Patty with one of the coins from the ship. When Squidward confusedly mumbles the words \"Mauna Loa,\" Mr. Krabs snatches the coin from him, reflecting that the Mauna Loa houses the ocean's largest hoard of treasure and that he has been searching for it his entire life. He then dubiously follows SpongeBob and Patrick to the hideout's entrance, which was made obvious by a sign that Patrick had put up.\nSpongeBob eventually shows Mr. Krabs the pile of coins, which causes Mr. Krabs to happily celebrate his lifelong goal finally being achieved. However, SpongeBob notices and points out to Mr. Krabs that the gold coins are actually tokens and have no monetary value. Mr. Krabs thinks that the fake stash is simply a decoy and believes the real treasure is hidden somewhere else on the ship, but upon further exploration, the trio finds a ticket booth, a height restriction chart, and a plastic skeleton wearing a captain's uniform. From this, Mr. Krabs comes to the conclusion that the ship is simply a derelict amusement park ride that holds no genuine treasure.\nDeeply frustrated, Mr. Krabs decides to leave, but then realizes he could make lots of money by opening the hideout to the public as an attraction ride, although he ignores the terrible, unsafe condition that the ride is in. Soon, the ride is busy in operation with many people, despite the obvious dangers, but the riders ignore the perils anyway. SpongeBob and Patrick, distraught at first about losing their secret hideout, eagerly decide to ride the attraction one last time.\nWhile in motion, the old ship loses planks of wood as it spins, one of which hits the ride's controls, pushing the throttle and accelerating the ride to \"beyond comprehension.\" The ride quickly picks up speed and spins over and over again around the swing, ejecting many riders off of the ship. SpongeBob and Patrick excitedly enjoy this ride, blissfully unaware of the many riders launched out of the ship.\nMeanwhile, one of the swing's supports, which was in bad disrepair, stresses as the ship swings around before finally snapping, causing the swing to shatter and tossing the ship high into the air. Aghast observers on the ride's sidelines watch as the ship, full of terrified riders as well as SpongeBob and Patrick, plummets to the ground, imploding into an askew pile of wood planks and shards.\nSpongeBob and Patrick, undisturbed and somehow unharmed by the impact, excitedly pop up from the rubble and comment that the ride was \"awesome\" and \"totally realistic.\" However, a battered rider, bruised and covered in splinters all over, angrily points out that the \"careless contraption\" of a ride nearly killed them all. The other riders emerge with various injuries and furiously surround Mr. Krabs, who quickly becomes arrested by a waiting police officer. The officer then comments that Mr. Krabs will be less of a public danger in prison.\nThe scene then transitions to the ride's entrance, boarded up and condemned, as a saddened SpongeBob and Patrick helplessly overlook. They leave the site, but are swallowed up by the ground and sink through. They land on the deck of another shipwreck, and SpongeBob then discovers it is the real Mauna Loa. SpongeBob then questions Patrick if he can keep a secret, with Patrick happily denying this.\n"}

Before he can start, a sound from his neighbors leads him to dropping his entire work onto the flame of a candle that burned on both sides. Therefore, his work was destroyed. Going outside to investigate the sounds, he finds Patrick hammering a sign on his front lawn. When SpongeBob suggests Patrick to strike it one more time, the hammer pushes it all the way into the gravel, only to destroy the sign.\nSquidward goes to his neighbors, complaining, asking what the noise is about. SpongeBob replies by saying that Patrick is renting out some property. A delighted Squidward thinks Patrick is moving out, only to find that he is renting out his yard for extra cash. SpongeBob asks Squidward to be on the lookout for takers who might want to stay on the yard while the duo goes jellyfishing.\nFor a while, the cultural neighbor enjoys peace from his neighbors, only to be interrupted by a resident named Howard. Lying to Howard about the rent sign being outdated, Howard plans to leave until Squidward says he is just kidding after Howard says he would have wanted to do many things that Squidward also enjoys. Howard invites Squidward for some tea and wants to discuss each other and the other neighbors.\nSpongeBob and Patrick return, finding Howard's mobile home, and Patrick is excited about meeting the new neighbor who hates what Patrick and SpongeBob do. Knowing that the two would convince Howard to leave, Squidward makes plans to hide the peaceful neighbor from SpongeBob and Patrick. Thinking that the new neighbor is shy, they wanted to come back later, which was really soon.\nWhen they are back, Howard and Squidward are performing with their instruments on some music. Hearing SpongeBob's laugh, Squidward tries to hide it by saying the sound is his broken clarinet. Instead of fixing it, he makes a wooden fence, followed by a stone wall then Squidward puts zippers to \"shut\" their mouths and then bulldozing SpongeBob's and Patrick's houses off a cliff, making the two follow it. Howard sees enough hiding and wanted to see the secrets behind the laughing and then finds the jellyfishers who are also playing with bubbles. Before stopping them, he gets used to the jellyfish and bubbles and become one of the annoying neighbors.\nMuch to his dismay, Squidward gets mad and can't tolerate three, so he brings Howard's mobile home out of place and pushes it off a cliff. Squidward becomes disappointed for almost having a decent neighbor, so SpongeBob and Patrick try to cheer him up by having him pop a bubble. He goes along with it, but the bubble keeps floating away, Squidward goes after it, and jumps off the cliff and gets a hard landing, leaving him exclaiming \"Jellyfishing bubble blowers!\" at SpongeBob and Patrick."}

Learning that his books about love are only \"torturing\" him, the depressed Squidward throws away his book and impacts on evil wisdom SpongeBob. When SpongeBob tries returning the book, Squidward claims the book is \"just a cruel reminder that I'm single, and likely to remain that way.\" SpongeBob tries cheering Squidward up by pointing out that while he's currently never found true love, that doesn't automatically mean he won't ever find it, and says, \"There's a squid for every pot!,\" but Squidward complains about that being a very clichéd saying.\nJust then, a female customer walks in and Squidward becomes instantly smitten with her. The woman admires the \"décor\" and Squidward believes that she's perfect since they seem to have the same interests and hobbies. Squidward decides to ask her out on a date, but when she comes up to the register, and Squidward's too nervous to ask her out on a date. Just as the woman is about to leave the restaurant, SpongeBob turns on the motor that's in the boat containing them and the register, and manages to prevent her from leaving. Squidward's still too nervous and love struck to say anything to her, so SpongeBob introduces them to each other, during which it's revealed that the woman's name is Squilvia. After SpongeBob tells Squilvia about Squidward, she agrees to go on a date with him later that night. After she leaves, SpongeBob points out that Squidward was pretty nervous back there and asks him about the last time he actually went on a date. Squidward gets even more nervous when he realizes just how long it's been since the last time he actually went on a date, so SpongeBob offers to help him prepare for it by making him go on a \"practice date.\"\nAs practice for the real date, he is tested at SpongeBob's house on complimenting about his date, giving flowers, driving to dinner, and having dinner, much to his annoyance. He drives in a circle from and to SpongeBob's house (which would be where the restaurant is). At the \"restaurant\" (SpongeBob's roof), Patrick serves plastic dinner which he literally takes a bite out of. When Squidward has had enough, he leaves and shouts angrily over how it was pointless. He goes down the stairs, and SpongeBob convinces Squidward to come back, but his shoe gets caught, causing him to fall down the stairs, revealing his true identity. Frustrated, Squidward yells at him for his pointless acts that wasted his time. Squidward turns around and sees that Squilvia showed up and saw everything. He expects her to be disgusted with him but she reveals that Squidward's true personality was better than what she expected. Squidward is excited with this, as he and Squilvia go on their date before he thanks SpongeBob for the help.

Patrick introduces SpongeBob to Sam and Sam, mistaking SpongeBob to be a danger, protects Patrick by throwing SpongeBob. Patrick suggests that they go inside to \"play,\" but Sam explains how the house is too small. Sam then takes a briefcase filled with sand and constructs a new house, made of sand. Patrick thanks her. However, Squidward complains that his house is filled with sand. Again, Sam feels overprotective and moves Squidward's house with only her bare hands. Squidward makes jokes about Sam saying, how she is bigger, and dumber than Patrick. Sam responds by getting angry and then starting to cry because she already knows it is all true. Her giant tears throw both Squidward and SpongeBob.\nAfter that, Patrick becomes overprotective of Sam by saying that SpongeBob and Squidward are \"meanies\" and saying that they should \"blecorate\" (decorate) the rock. However, she uses parts of Squidward's house to decorate it, damaging it greatly. Then Squidward gets angry and calls her a thief. Then SpongeBob tries to talk some sense into Patrick, but Patrick does not care that Sam deliberately dismantled Squidward's house. Then he starts crying, thinking SpongeBob has become a traitor and gets head-butted by Sam along with Squidward back to their houses, damaging his house further. Squidward gets angry and drops a rock on the house, ruining the \"spiffy.\" In response, Sam and Patrick come out of the house and Sam chews up the loose parts and spits them at Squidward's house, completely destroying it.\nIn the last act of retaliation, Squidward then drives a bulldozer at Patrick, Sam, and the house, trying to destroy it in a crazed rage.

The chase goes right by him and he starts chasing after SpongeBob and Tony Jr.  He is angry as SpongeBob and Tony Jr. are clueless as to what they should do.  Tony Jr. tries to calm SpongeBob once again and he declines his advice this time due to where it has gotten them.  He drives through the sign of the Boating school and runs into Mrs. Puff as she inflates.

{"prompt": "A Friendly Game", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob goes over to Patrick's house so they can play a game of golf. However, before their game can begin, it starts to rain. Patrick tries to tell the rain to stop, but he winds up getting struck by lightning and screams. While hearing the noise outside, Squidward opens his window and tells them to keep it at a low rumble. While it is raining outside, SpongeBob and Patrick decide to build a golf course in SpongeBob's house. While they are building, the noise wakes Squidward up. Squidward tells SpongeBob and Patrick to not make any more noise \"Or else.\" Patrick does everything he can to distract SpongeBob and make him lose. SpongeBob and Patrick's golf balls smash through SpongeBob's window after they hit them too hard and land right in Squidward's window.\nSpongeBob decides to end the game, but Patrick ignores him and enters Squidward's house to look for his ball. While searching, Patrick stops to rummage through Squidward's fridge and eats most of his food including some kelp salad, only to discover he has also eaten SpongeBob's ball, which was hiding in it. SpongeBob offers to get the ball out, but he declines and tells Patrick he has to \"play the ball where it lands.\" After hitting his ball out of Patrick's body, Patrick finds his ball stuck in his bum, SpongeBob reminds him again that he must \"play it where it lands.\" Patrick gets a hole in one and SpongeBob tells him he could do it blindfolded, so Patrick hands him a blindfold. Patrick helps SpongeBob find his ball by playing hot or cold, but since SpongeBob cannot see, he accidentally breaks Squidward's furniture and paintings. It turns out Patrick also took a shower in Squidward's bathroom while accidentally giving SpongeBob bad directions. Finally annoyed with Patrick's laziness, SpongeBob drags him out and they go off to search the house.\nThey soon find both balls have landed in Squidward's room, Patrick's golf ball is on Squidward's head and SpongeBob's golf ball is in his mouth.

When he takes out his garbage, Patrick reprimands him for letting go of all these sentimental items and saying they still have values to them. After pondering the concept, SpongeBob agrees and fights the garbage truck's claw for his trash.\nThe next day at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob begins collecting random items such as mayonnaise, sweat, ketchup packets, gum from under the tables, grill grease, chewed-up bendy straws, and order tickets. Soon, he becomes a hoarder, but he runs out of the room and starts piling it in his front yard. Squidward starts to get annoyed by his new habit and tells him that he has to throw away his \"junk.\" SpongeBob tells him that he cannot because they hold too many memories, but is unaware he is hoarding.\nSquidward then calls the sanitation police. They condemn the house because it is filled with junk and that SpongeBob is a \"threat to public health.\" They tell him he has to evacuate the pineapple immediately. Squidward is happy until they condemn his house for being filled with SpongeBob's \"junk.\" When SpongeBob asks the police if there is anything he can do, they tell him what he can do. SpongeBob has to choose to evacuate the pineapple or throw away his \"junk.\"\nSpongeBob decides to throw them away, but he takes pictures of everything first. Squidward is then happy again and plans to go back to bed. But he discovers that SpongeBob took so many pictures that he put some of his pictures in Squidward's house, without Squidward's permission, and all the pictures flood Patrick, Squidward, and SpongeBob's front yards.

Patrick says that he hopes he wins, but he only has gummy worms that lead his sled. Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Squidward, SpongeBob, and Sandy also prepare for the race. However, Plankton sneaks off to the Krusty Krab just before the race begins and uses a robot as his replacement in the race.

Squidward gets angry and goes on foot, only to fall through the ice and freeze. He is soon discovered by SpongeBob and Patrick, who take him along with them. Shortly after, they find Sandy in a pile of snow and they bring her along too. Mr. Krabs' worms become hungry, and they get mad and chase Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob lets Mr. Krabs come along as well. The worms chase SpongeBob and the gang, and Gary has trouble pulling all of them. They are cornered at a dead end and Gary roars like a lion to scare the worms away.\nThe gang decides to stop there and make a fire. Squidward thaws out, just before encountering The Abominable Snow Mollusk, who tries to attack the group. Squidward runs away and jumps into a cold body of water, which freezes him again. The group continues the race and realize that they forgot Squidward soon after. They go after him and save him from the Snow Mollusk with the help of Patrick's last gummy worm. They continue on, and Sandy realizes that Mr. Krabs has betrayed the group and gone off on his own so that he could win the prize himself, but gets stung by a jellyfish that flew into his mouth in the process.\nPatrick then stops the sleigh and points out that he \"saw something shiny\" and SpongeBob notices that it is Karen. They also discover robot Plankton, who is buried in the snow, and Karen explains that the whole race was a plot for him to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula from the Krusty Krab undetected.

Meanwhile, SpongeBob pulls the sled until they find a frozen Mr. Krabs, whom they later inform about what Plankton is doing. All of them, except Sandy, freeze. Sandy saves their lives by starting a fire with parts from the sled. Sandy figures out how to use the members of the group as a substitute sled. They return to Bikini Bottom to see that the Krusty Krab has been destroyed and Plankton has stolen the formula. However, he cannot get the bottle open. The group finds Plankton trying to open it. When Plankton expresses his frustration at not being able to open the bottle, Patrick \"dumb-ly\" opens the bottle, allowing Plankton to finally take the formula out.\nPlankton then pretends to surrender and uses a pen to fly away out of the Chum Bucket. The group chases Plankton into a net trap that Plankton trapped them in. However, the Snow Mollusk returns, frees the group, and eats Patrick's jelly beans, then hugs the pink sea star. Plankton escapes, but the Snow Mollusk mistakes him for a jelly bean and eats him, dropping the secret formula and returning the formula to Mr. Krabs in the process, with Karen showing no sympathy for Plankton.

Suddenly, Patrick falls asleep, where he is revealed to have suddenly grown a beard when he awakens. When Squidward passes by and notices the beard, he offers to teach Patrick everything he knows about how to be mature, much to SpongeBob's dismay. He decides to follow them, promising he will learn how to be mature as well. SpongeBob thinks Patrick is captured by Squidward and brainwashed as his apprentice, sidekick and pawn.\nThe three go into Squidward's house for a grown-up makeover. SpongeBob shows off his new look. Patrick likes his look until Squidward reminds him that he really should not. They then go to a restaurant, and Patrick and Squidward order some tetrazzini while SpongeBob orders the milk and cookies.\nThen, they go to the art place and SpongeBob follows them around and Patrick and Squidward tell the security to kick him out and he first put him out softly, but he does not leave, so he ends up kicking him. SpongeBob sees Squidward and Patrick walking and Squidward mentions that the beard was the best thing that ever happened to Patrick other than himself. SpongeBob realizes that the only way to snap Patrick out of his brainwashing state is to rescue him from Squidward and restore his friendship. He tries to remove his beard. Squidward stops him and says that they are through with him. SpongeBob comes up with a plan to snap Patrick out of his brainwashing state.\nThen, Squidward and Patrick go to the Opera House. SpongeBob disguises himself as an opera performer as his plan to rescue Patrick from Squidward's tentacles, so Patrick and Squidward could see a lady, which is really SpongeBob, singing opera, which Patrick says \"She's beautiful.\" After SpongeBob sang opera to win Patrick back, Patrick begins to cry and sees HIS beard is really a sea urchin in hibernation, which breaks Patrick's brainwashed state. The sea urchin wakes up from Patrick's tears, and runs away from him. He chased it until SpongeBob says Patrick's name and he says \"How do you know my name?\" and he says that he is SpongeBob and they make up again.

SpongeBob explains that he is practicing for an oral report that he must do for boating school. Squidward says that \"public speaking\" causes stress, but then SpongeBob explains how he is good at \"public speaking.\" SpongeBob then walks out, ready to give the customers their orders, and gets scared because they are acting zombie-like.\nSpongeBob then realizes that he has stage fright. The customers start fighting for the single order as Squidward is beaten up after trying to give a customer his order, which makes SpongeBob even more frightened.\nIt then cuts to Patrick's rock. Patrick opens it, only to realize he has the wrong rock, but SpongeBob pulls him in. SpongeBob asks Patrick to help him practice by listening to his speech. SpongeBob has to practice if he wants to pass then he has to give the report.\nSpongeBob begins to become very nervous, and Patrick decides that SpongeBob should see Sandy for help. Sandy deduces SpongeBob has a severe case of \"Oral-Reportitis,\" which is caused by stress of someone too nervous to present an oral report before a crowd. To help him out, Sandy gives SpongeBob a pair of underwear with goggles on it, so SpongeBob can see people in their underwear so he will not feel nervous.\nThe next day, SpongeBob is next to do his oral report and then he gets nervous for a prolonged time. SpongeBob asks Patrick for the goggles, and he gives SpongeBob the goggles while accidentally breaking them in the process while trying to polish them. Billy tells him to hurry up, and SpongeBob sees him in his underwear; he is relieved. Then he sees the whole class in their underwear. SpongeBob begins laughing and Mrs. Puff asks him why. SpongeBob sees Mrs. Puff's underwear and starts laughing even harder. SpongeBob begins reading his report but the goggles malfunction, causing it to give him the sight of everybody's underwear having scary faces. SpongeBob screams and runs away, he drives Mrs. Puff's boat, and Patrick and Mrs. Puff chase him. The police notice that SpongeBob ran a stop light and chase after him. SpongeBob then crashes through various buildings. The police question if he knows about \"boating safety\" and SpongeBob goes through a long explanation of \"boating safety.\" The police start crying and say it is beautiful. Mrs. Puff says that SpongeBob will have to go to jail and she will not have to teach him anymore. The police arrests Mrs. Puff because under penal code 26-1, SpongeBob's delinquent actions is under Mrs. Puff's care because she is his boating teacher, much to her dismay.

An annoyed Squidward tells him about real music and plays his clarinet, causing the customers to run away from the Krusty Krab. After being told to stop by Mr. Krabs, Squidward goes outside and throws a tantrum, complaining that no one appreciates his music. Plankton, watching from the Chum Bucket, believes that Squidward may be the key to the Krabby Patty secret formula.\nLater, Plankton tries talking to Squidward, but he fails to. Then, he makes several attempts to trick Squidward, among these were pretending to be a girl scout and pretending to be one of Squidward's species, all resulting in Plankton getting the door literally slammed in his face. SpongeBob tells Plankton that he might gain Squidward's friendship if he compliments him on his music.\nPlankton later meets with Squidward and persuades him to play his clarinet. At first, Plankton is tormented by the awful clarinet music, but then wears Professional Grade Earplugs to block the noise and pretends to like it. Squidward marches across Bikini Bottom, playing his clarinet, and Plankton follows along, while everyone else is tormented by the noise. Plankton also sings a song about Squidward's clarinet music as Squidward plays bad notes.\nThis friendship, however, does not last, as Plankton tells Squidward about the secret formula. Squidward tells Plankton that despite 20 years of working, he had never seen the making of a Krabby Patty. Squidward tells Plankton that his music is getting better and plays his clarinet, making windows and mirrors across Bikini Bottom crack and break. Squidward then says that he is going to quit his job and become a full-time musician. Plankton gets so angry that his earplugs come off, and he is once again tortured by the noise.\nPlankton steals the clarinet, causing Squidward and SpongeBob to chase after him. SpongeBob frees Squidward from Plankton's control. Plankton is shortly confronted by the police about a \"bad music\" crime and is arrested for being the only one to hold the clarinet, freeing Squidward from being brainwashed.

{"prompt": "The Googly Artiste", "completion": "The episode starts at Squidward's house. Squidward is shown pushing what appears to be a sculpture with a sheet over it into his yard. Then, Patrick and SpongeBob call to him and ask if he wants to join them in making arts and crafts. He solemnly says \"No,\" and tells them that he is a true artist and has a hat to prove it. SpongeBob says he weaved a basket, a wallet, and money. Patrick is trying to weave a basket but fails (due to the fact that he kept hammering his finished piece). Squidward walks away bitterly and Patrick becomes upset that he cannot make art like SpongeBob and Squidward. SpongeBob shows Patrick how to make a rock with googly eyes on it. Patrick repeats this process and SpongeBob is very impressed (though his rock had googly eyes all over it instead of two normal eyes). Squidward insults their artwork and soon after, an art critic visits and judges Squidward's work (which is a statue of himself). The art critic says that it is hideous and confiscates Squidward's hat. Then, the art critic judges SpongeBob's art and says it is lame. He then judges Patrick's art and mentions how it was so wonderful and creative. He gives him $500 and Squidward's hat for it. Squidward is angry at this and repeatedly says over and over \"I bet he won't sell another\" until SpongeBob stops him. After Patrick sells four more rocks, Squidward states that he actually would prefer to go to work and both SpongeBob and Squidward leave to go to the Krusty Krab.\nMeanwhile, Patrick's artwork becomes so famous that he runs out of rocks, so he tries to find something else to make art with. First, he paints a beautiful scenery of the night sky and says it is lame. Then, he sculpts a man sitting down, thinking and says that it stinks. Patrick goes to the Krusty Krab since it is his lunch time and he orders art advice. Squidward complains that is not on the menu until Patrick points out that it is: Mr. Krabs has put it on the menu for $25. Mr. Krabs tells Squidward to give Patrick art advice. But Squidward does not want to give advice to the artist who upstaged him and only tells him to concentrate on his patty. This gives Patrick the idea to put googly eyes on the patty. His Googly Patty gets famous once the art critic mentions that it is the next big thing. Everyone rushes to the Krusty Krab to get one. When Mr. Krabs hears the sound of cha-ching, he rushes to the cash register and finds no money. He is surprised until he looks up and sees customers pay Patrick for the Patties. He then sees SpongeBob sending Krabby Patties out to Patrick. He pulls SpongeBob and Patrick into his office and demands an explanation and, to his fury, learns that Patrick is ordering Krabby Patties for $3 for his googly art which he then sells for $50. Squidward sneers at them for getting into trouble, but Patrick explains that he was following Squidward's advice. Hearing this, Mr. Krabs realizes this is all Squidward's doing and gets very angry at him. So, Mr. Krabs put good use to Squidward to punish him and get money.\nNow, Krabby Patties are served at $50. The fish who orders the patty says it is not expensive. Then, the fish goes to Patrick's stall. Patrick calls his apprentice, which is really Squidward. Squidward adds glue on the fish's patty and Patrick says that Squidward could be an artist one day. Squidward then bursts into tears, as the episode ends."}

For example, SpongeBob says to Mr. Krabs that he will have free money, says to Squidward that he will have a latte sipping contest, and says to Sandy that she will have a science experiment. Everyone goes to his house, only to be surprised and disappointed that they are going to see vacation slides, which they do not care about. They are about to leave, but SpongeBob persuades them back.\nThe adventure starts with Patrick squirting the Cheese Fizz on the camera. SpongeBob's parents pull up and get him and Patrick in. SpongeBob looks at a brochure and Patrick suggests a game- Hide and Seek. Patrick gets on the windshield of the boat and Harold yells \"Egad!!!\"' and loses control. They slide and burst into The Outskirts Outlet Mega-Mall, and Basscar Racing Stadium. Then, they fling off the stadium and head straight into space where a floating cow gets hit by them and lands on the moon. Then, they fall back down to the Earth and slide down a rocky cliff onto the road. SpongeBob then suggests they sing a road song. Everyone sings the road song, and at the end of the song, the engine blows up. They move the boat to a local service station. They wait in an outhouse. Margaret sees a playground and offers SpongeBob and Patrick to play on it. They do, but they slide down a sewer pipe and onto a small puddle.\nWhen they get up, they try to get back up, but they cannot. They enter a mysterious red kelp forest with many mushrooms. They hear a hollering noise and run. It turns out it is a small creature. They jump over a cliff, onto an anemone and onto a mushroom. Behind Patrick is a giant fruit fly. They run away and go behind a rock. They hear a noise. It came from a gift shop. SpongeBob wastes his money on useless knick-knacks. They sing the road song wearily. Then, SpongeBob decides to play the road song on a flute he bought at the gift shop.\nThey walk along past Harold and Margaret and into the forest again. Animals follow them. The animals suddenly run away because the giant fruit fly is behind them. SpongeBob stops playing. When they turn around, they see the fruit fly wants to give them a lift. They then sing the above the road song. He drops SpongeBob and Patrick off. SpongeBob's parents call them over, but SpongeBob and Patrick just fall asleep.

{"prompt": "Patrick's Staycation", "completion": "The episode begins with Patrick putting the slide projector onto a table, leaping onto it, shaping his head into a ten-gallon hat, then riding the projector like a horse, followed by him eating hash browns. SpongeBob reminds him that he has a slideshow to give, but Patrick destroys the projector in the process. Instead, Patrick makes a shadow puppet show with a lamp, and the show begins. SpongeBob goes to Patrick's house and knocks on the rock. Inside, Patrick is heard moaning and complaining. When the rock finally opens, Patrick's hand is seen holding a key. When SpongeBob enters, Patrick is seen on the floor, still holding the key. SpongeBob asks Patrick if he did something wrong, and he explains that all he has been doing is waking up, eating, and sleeping, and that he needs a break. SpongeBob suggests a vacation, and Patrick's spirits are lifted.\nWhen they go to the travel agency, Patrick is given options, but when it is revealed that he cannot afford any of these trips, he and SpongeBob are thrown out. SpongeBob suggests Patrick go on a \"staycation,\" a vacation at home. Patrick goes for it.\nWhen he arrives home, he sees his living room has been redesigned as a hotel's entrance, and SpongeBob (calling himself \"Todd\") is the receptionist. \"Todd\" gives Patrick his key, and shows him his room. Patrick does not like the way the room is designed and asks SpongeBob to redesign it. All the furniture is now stacked into one large pile, and Patrick, still not satisfied, tells SpongeBob it is probably the walls. As SpongeBob becomes exasperated with Patrick's idiocy, the furniture collapses in a heap of sand. Later, there is a tub of water, which SpongeBob calls it \"the pool.\" Patrick is initially excited but asks where the diving board is. SpongeBob makes one out of a stool and a plank of wood. When Patrick dives off of it, he hits his head on the side of the tub and falls in. When Patrick is drowning, SpongeBob dresses up as a lifeguard and pulls him out. When Patrick gets hungry, SpongeBob dresses like a French chef and prepares a Krabby Patty on a grill. Just then, Mr. Krabs comes along, requesting payment and a tip. Patrick demands a show to go with his meal, so SpongeBob dances on the table. Patrick dismisses it as \"boring.\" SpongeBob then puts his spatula on his head and makes a pineapple appear. Patrick dismisses it as \"lame.\" SpongeBob launches the pineapple into the air, where it is sliced in an overhead airplane's turbines. When it lands on a plate, Patrick tells SpongeBob \"You are smoking.\" He means it literally: the Krabby Patty is burning, and a large cloud of black smoke fills the air.\nPatrick walks out of the smoke like he is opening a door, still hungry. He catches a delicious aroma coming from Squidward's home, which turns out to be soup. Squidward puts a bowl on his table but turns around to get a napkin. When he returns to the table, Patrick is eating his soup. Meanwhile, SpongeBob emerges from the cloud of smoke, presenting a burnt Krabby Patty which soon turns into dust and blows away in the wind. Patrick is nowhere to be found, but he hears Squidward yelling. Patrick seems to think Squidward's house is a hotel, and even plans to go to the spa and get a massage. Squidward angrily explains to him that there is no spa and his house is not a hotel, but SpongeBob gives Patrick the massage he wanted. Patrick suggests Squidward should get one as well. Though Squidward is reluctant at first, his shoulder snaps. Squidward then pushes Patrick off the table and asks SpongeBob to give him a massage. After fulfilling Squidward's request, SpongeBob is exhausted and returns home. He goes to bed, but Patrick is in there in bed with him, apparently convinced that SpongeBob's house is also a hotel. Patrick then goes to sleep as a confused and tired SpongeBob looks on.\nThe scene changes to Mr. Krabs gargling with mouthwash in the bathroom of his house. When he goes to his bedroom, SpongeBob is sleeping in his hammock. Mr. Krabs wakes him up and asks SpongeBob if he has had a nightmare and asks if Patrick is in his bed (again), and SpongeBob says no to the former and yes to the latter. Understanding, Mr. Krabs bids SpongeBob a good night, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Walking the Plankton", "completion": "The episode starts with Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob's friends at SpongeBob's house, where Plankton stands in front of a film projector, calling himself \"The Great Genie of the Slide Carousel.\" He says he will make them watch his slideshow, but in the process, one of the slides presses against him and the light, later burning him, then he starts screaming and destroys the projector. SpongeBob saves the show when he inserts the light in himself and holds the slides up. Then, the show begins.\nAt the Krusty Krab, the mailman arrives with a letter, and SpongeBob runs out to greet him. The mailman grumbles, \"Boy, if I weren't already on parole,\" and walks off. SpongeBob takes the letter to Mr. Krabs and opens it. Inside are free tickets for a cruise for Mr. Krabs and one guest. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob he can come along if he agrees to be his manservant, and SpongeBob accepts. The tickets were part of Plankton's plot to once again steal the Krabby Patty secret formula, and he is seen watching Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob preparing for the vacation from his telescope. However, when Mr. Krabs says he will take the recipe with him as a precaution against \"a certain one-eyed creepy crawly,\" Plankton uses Plan B: go on the cruise with them. He tells Karen they are going on a cruise, and she is initially excited until she is struck with the realization that this is part of his plan to steal the Krabby Patty formula. He lies to her and tells her it is their second honeymoon, to which Karen angrily replies they have never even had a first one. Plankton sets the dial on her vacation dial-up, making her giddy. Plankton prepares his suitcase, but Karen, in her excitement, uses the death laser to slice it in half. Plankton sets the vacation dial lower. While on the cruise, Karen enjoys herself as she and Plankton lie on lounge chairs.\nAs he puts sunscreen on her monitor (to prevent \"screenburn\"), Plankton catches sight of SpongeBob pushing Mr. Krabs around in a wheelchair. He mutters his plans, but Karen asks, \"Who are you denouncing now?\" Plankton lies and says the server is late with the hors d'oeuvres. When the server arrives, Plankton takes one of the crackers and gets kelp cheese on his head. Karen, still in a giddy mood, laughs and tells him that the snack is as large as he is. This gives Plankton an idea. Knowing that he will be in trouble if he tries to steal the Krabby Patty in front of Karen, he sculpts the cheese into his likeness and sneaks off. After being crushed underneath the wheelchair, he returns to his lounge chair, where Karen wakes up from sleep mode. When he sees them again, he massages her wheels, causing her to fall asleep again. Then, he follows Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob into the steam room, hiding in a bucket of water. However, a large and sweaty fish named Bubble Bust comes along, gets a ladleful of water (and Plankton), and pours it onto his back. Plankton screams as he slides down Bubble Bust's back and into his speedo. When SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are playing shuffleboard, Plankton hides under a puck, but is soon flung away when Mr. Krabs hits the puck he was hiding under. When Mr. Krabs is on water skis, Plankton attempts to cut the rope that keeps him attached to the cruise ship, but he falls overboard and into the ship's propellers, which slice him up. Plankton climbs back on board, lifting his severed lower half up after him, and gives up stealing the recipe.\nMr. Krabs and SpongeBob go to the free land food buffet. Mr. Krabs bites into corn (biting off the cob), then spits it out, into SpongeBob's mouth. Disgusted by how the food tastes (saying it tastes like \"putrefied coral stems dipped in rotten butter sauce\"), he has SpongeBob cook him some Krabby Patties. The passengers, attracted by the smell, line up, giving Mr. Krabs the idea to sell Krabby Patties on board. Plankton wears a disguise as he makes his order, and Mr. Krabs thinks he has \"suckered\" him into paying $100 for a Krabby Patty. However, when he sees Plankton's money is covered with chum, he asks him where he got it. Plankton triumphantly replies, \"From the same place this is going...to the Chum Bucket laboratory!\" Plankton removes his disguise and flies off with the patty. Though he stays ahead of the pursuing SpongeBob, he is stopped when he slams into Karen's monitor. She is furious with Plankton, not only because he was after the Krabby Patty all along, but because he ruined their honeymoon. She sets her vacation dial to maximum, despite Plankton's warnings, and happily fires her lasers, destroying the ship by cutting it in half. The passengers and the captain, the latter of whom grumbles, \"If I weren't on parole!\" row away in lifeboats and some jump off the ship, as well as Plankton and Karen. Mr. Krabs laments the loss of his customers, while Plankton and Karen are seen rowing away in a lifeboat. The episode ends with Plankton playing the role of the gondolier, to his wife's amusement."}
{"prompt": "Mooncation", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob and Patrick go to Sandy's treedome, but are knocked aside by monkeys leaving her home. They hold a slide carousel, mentioning they confiscated it. SpongeBob and Patrick ask Sandy what is going on, and she says she has a copy of the slide carousel to show them. The show begins.\nIn the show, SpongeBob meets Sandy, who is preparing for a trip to the moon. She asks him to help her with her luggage, but he runs off to the bakery. He tries to take a number, but gets tangled in the tickets from the dispenser, to the baker's annoyance. The baker asks for \"Number 12,\" and SpongeBob gives him his ticket. Through gritted teeth, the irritated baker asks him what he would like. SpongeBob says he would like a bon voyage sheet cake with \"yummy letters.\" He asks the baker to write, \"Have fun on the moon,\" but thinks of what would rhyme with moon (goon, rune, noon, tune), while the baker angrily suggests loon, but he goes with \"See you soon.\" He takes the cake to Sandy's, but her rocket just started the countdown. It lifts its ladder, but SpongeBob leaps on, and into the ship. Sandy is annoyed, and says she must adjust for the newly added weight of SpongeBob. The ship blasts off, and soon they are in space. While in there, SpongeBob presents her with the cake. She warns him that food that is not contained will fall apart in a zero-gravity environment, which the cake promptly does. She says everything will be fine unless it gets into the vent, and once again, the cake does just that. She climbs into a special suit and goes out to remove the cake from the vents. While standing out there, she takes a bit of the cake and says it could use \"more nuts.\" She returns to the ship, and the moon is getting closer. Sandy picks a crater as a good place to land the ship.\nWhen they exit the ship, Sandy sandboards on the moon, showing off many of her moves, such as the \"Flippity-Doo Dah,\" the classic Texas tail grab (where Sandy grabs her tail to the shape of Texas with a star on it), and the 7-20 nut-job (where she slices a moon rock to an acorn, and eats it), including one where she lies on Saturn's rings; the \"Tour de Saturn.\"\nWhen it is SpongeBob's turn to sandboard, he floats away, since he is too light in the moon's gravity. Sandy uses a lasso made with a rope and a moon rock, and tells SpongeBob to grab it. He does, and falls to the moon. While screaming and holding onto the moon rock, he shows amazing skills, which impresses Sandy. SpongeBob tries again, but this time, his board crashes into the fuel tank, causing it to leak. Sandy pulls SpongeBob back to the ship, telling him they need to return home while there is still enough fuel left. They manage to make it back to Earth, but the steep dive means they will turn into a giant fireball, which causes SpongeBob to panic. Sandy goes outside to \"grab this bull by the horns\" and lassos the ship, pulling it out of its dive. It flies over Bikini Bottom, doing loop-de-loops, and eventually crashing to the ground. SpongeBob sees an unconscious Sandy lying on the ground and tearfully apologizes for ruining her vacation. Sandy tells him he did not ruin her vacation; she had a great time. She plans on taking him with her to Mars next, then jokingly suggests he bring her cakes more often, and they laugh, as the episode ends."}

In his office, Mr. Krabs says that he will take either Squidward or SpongeBob with him and Pearl on a road trip, but then Squidward gets up and leaves, leaving Mr. Krabs to choose SpongeBob for the trip. In the boat, Pearl is not happy, she throws a suitcase onto SpongeBob, telling him not to get up until they leave Bikini Bottom.

Mr. Krabs tries to comfort her, saying that they were not going there anyways. He then says that they are going to the Bikini Bottom Mint to see the money making process, but Pearl says that she would rather search through the rubble of the \"Teenage Boy Museum\" and proceeds to do so. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs then go inside and meet the tour guide, Bill. SpongeBob laughs, but Bill is aware of the irony of his job and name.\nThey got through some areas in the building, but because of Mr. Krabs' obsession for money, he disturbs the crowd and even gets himself in dangerous situations. When he gets to the money shredding area, Mr. Krabs starts crying, which floods the factory. SpongeBob absorbs the water and shoots it out the wall, destroying the autographed photo that Pearl finds.

{"prompt": "Ghoul Fools", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob and Patrick are lying on the ground and watch the clouds until they see a haunted houseboat crashing to ground near them. Patrick wants to check it out, but SpongeBob says that it looks dangerous. Patrick soon convinces SpongeBob to come with him, so the friends go check it out. Patrick thinks the boat is lame, but SpongeBob thinks it is real. SpongeBob looks at a painting of flowers that is in the boat and states that it is pretty, but soon the flowers turn into snakes and hiss at SpongeBob, which makes him panic.\nThen, they meet Lord Poltergeist (who Patrick stupidly thinks is a robot that serves pizza). Lord Poltergeist says that he will sing a sea shanty to make SpongeBob and Patrick believe he is a real ghost. At the end of the song, Poltergeist asks if they believe now, but Patrick still does not believe and says he wants pizza, so Lord Poltergeist gives him pizza that has anchovies on it, which scares them out of their wits. This causes them to fearfully acknowledge him as a real ghost, even causing a scared Patrick to be willing to sacrifice SpongeBob to save himself while the unamused Lord Poltergeist sarcastically remarks \"That's a pretty nice friend, you got there.\" SpongeBob then asks why Lord Poltergeist is in Bikini Bottom and it is because there is a broken head gasket. Lord Poltergeist takes their souls but gives SpongeBob a doubloon to buy a new head gasket. He says that if they do not return with a new head gasket in 24 hours, their souls will be gone forever.\nSpongeBob and Patrick run to the Krusty Krab and tell the customers about the ghosts, though their freaked out behavior causes the customers to flee. Mr. Krabs orders SpongeBob to calm down, as he wants to know what is with the chaos. SpongeBob calms down and tells Mr. Krabs about how Lord Poltergeist stole their souls and gave them a doubloon to buy a head gasket. Mr. Krabs takes the doubloon and, after seeing it is real, he takes a head gasket from a boat that is outside the Krusty Krab, to the owner's ire. Mr. Krabs forces Squidward to come along with them after promising him a break room if he does come along and steal the ghost's treasure. Sandy then appears with ghost equipment, claiming she was looking for \"milkshake gremlins\" and wants to catch some ghosts.\nThe five go back to the boat where Lord Poltergeist was seen. Mr. Krabs steals the doubloons and hands bags of them to Squidward and Patrick. Mr. Krabs then sees a doubloon that is stuck to the bottom of the chest. He tries to pull it out, but ends up setting off a trap which causes Lord Poltergeist to appear. SpongeBob gives him the head gasket and the lord gives SpongeBob and Patrick orange soda instead of their souls and reveals that he never took their souls in the first place. He sucks Mr. Krabs, Squidward and Patrick (who are trying to escape with the gold) into a void, and shows them their greatest fears.\nFirst, Mr. Krabs has to use the restroom and finds a portable bathroom, but to use it, he must pay one doubloon and he screams at the thought of spending his loot. Next, Patrick wishes for a doughnut and then a talking one comes up on his head that Patrick annoys and the doughnut yells at him to pick something already. Patrick wishes for a doughnut with sprinkles, then chocolate, then a bagel, then a stack of pancakes, then a Krabby Patty, until he decides to go back to a plain doughnut. The doughnut screams at the fact that it must deal with Patrick for eternity as the starfish is oblivious to the fact that he had outsmarted his worst nightmare, something Lord Poltergeist intended to be impossible. Finally, Squidward encounters a giant SpongeBob, which makes him scream. Sandy sucks the three back into her ghost hunting equipment. Then, Mr. Krabs and Lord Poltergeist fight for the chest of doubloons. They fling it into the air and SpongeBob catches it and sees a \"Property of the Flying Dutchman\" stamp at the bottom of the chest followed by a phone number. The Flying Dutchman comes by to reclaim his doubloons (but ends up being tricked by Lord Poltergeist that they were looking for him to give him back the gold). Lord Poltergeist runs away until the boat breaks down.\nFinally, the Flying Dutchman turns into a torpedo that makes a huge void that sucks everyone inside. As the episode finishes with the Krusty Krab in the void with new workers and customers, SpongeBob tells everyone to hold on to something, he tells Giant Demonic SpongeBob from the void to flip the restaurant. He does so, and then his face turns into the Flying Dutchman's and he laughs evilly."}

SpongeBob and Patrick go to Squidward's house, but the wind destroys his house too, so they decide to go to the Mermalair to ask the heroes about their origin personally. \nOnce they are there, Mermaid Man tells them the story. He was once a regular human being who was washed into the ocean and sucked into a whirlpool. Before he could drown, mermaids came and gave him a magical starfish that enabled him to breathe underwater. Shortly after, Mermaid Man saw Barnacle Boy scraping some barnacles off a ship's hull and thought that he was drowning. He used his newfound powers to draw barnacles into Barnacle Boy's lungs, allowing him to breathe underwater as well. They then decided to become a crime-fighting duo, though Barnacle Boy argues that this was only because he was stuck breathing underwater forever as a result of Mermaid Man's actions. The two heroes go on to talk about some of their earliest rescues, but soon begin to argue about what really happened.  \nJust then, the actual origin special appears on the Mermalair's giant monitor. In the special, after cooking popcorn for movie night, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy (called Ernie and Tim respectively) are thrust into a series of nonsensical, random events. Once they return to their apartment, the overcooked popcorn strikes the two with a jolt of cosmic energy, giving them superpowers and the urge to breathe underwater. They dive into the sea and start fighting crime.\nAfter the show ends, SpongeBob and Patrick put popcorn into a microwave with the intention of overcooking it and giving themselves powers of their own, and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy try to stop them."}

It does not open, even after Plankton studies the combination. Plankton soon falls off onto the floor. Mr. Krabs bursts in and, mistaking Plankton for a pickle, he puts him in his mouth, and then spits him out, making Plankton bruised and injured all over. Approximately ten hours later, Plankton arrives at the Chum Bucket, when Karen suggests that Plankton should get a second eye to see the safe's combination more clearly as she states that with only one eye, he lacks depth perception. The two-eye surgery Plankton attempts results in him turning into a creature with many eyes that combine to make one huge eye. On the second try, Plankton's new eye turns into an eye-creature with robotic legs. Finally, Karen says Plankton needs teardrops successfully complete the procedure, so he makes himself cry, only to be told by Karen that he needs teardrops from a person that has two eyes. So, Plankton pursues SpongeBob to get him to cry. After finding him having a picnic, Plankton tells SpongeBob a sad story about himself and his milk spilling and Plankton actually does what happened in the story, causing SpongeBob to cry uncontrollably. Plankton gets the tear sample he sought after and begins the third surgery, in which Karen drops SpongeBob's tear liquid into Plankton's eye. An eye similar to one of SpongeBob's sprouts from his face, and Plankton sees things as SpongeBob does, that is, all happy and full of optimism. He goes after the secret formula but instead stops to admire the beauty of his surroundings.\nWhen Plankton arrives again at the Chum Bucket near the end of the day, Karen realizes that the second eye is giving Plankton a split personality, calling him \"Neevil.\" Plankton is stubborn and denies her claim, however, and tries to disprove her by stealing the formula, but Plankton is, once again, distracted by Bubble Bass, who is in need of a rescue from a burning building. After the rescue, Plankton randomly finds the formula on the ground and returns it to Mr. Krabs like a nice person, but Mr. Krabs, however, thinks Plankton is playing a trick. It is now that Plankton finally realizes that he is actually non-evil now, so he tries to remove the eye several times but fails.\nPlankton returns to the Chum Bucket and falls into despair. However, a surprise party is thrown for Plankton's good deeds. It seems that everybody in town is at the party. As SpongeBob and all of his friends hug Plankton, the second eye pops off.

Thinking all hope is lost, she locks herself in the restroom and cries violently.\nSpongeBob then decides to simply hide the barnacles under a layer of facial cream, which ends up making Pearl's face look severely deformed and causing her to be unable to talk. Finally, Pearl asks SpongeBob to get her more soap from the basement's soap press, where he finds Mr. Krabs producing the house's soap.

After this attempt fails, Patrick tries to give Gary a \"bath\" that involves the opposite of water: burning him alive with a flamethrower, but the next time SpongeBob calls, they are actually having fun, thanks to a flood that Patrick caused by spraying a running hose at him previously and leaving the sink and bathtub on, but SpongeBob mistakes them for being in \"danger.\"\nSpongeBob quickly ends his grandmother's birthday and rushes home to see what the fuss is about, so he arrives home after a long, tiring run and sees that his house is destroyed and filled with water when he opens the door.

SpongeBob is confused, but when Squidward tells him that he cannot prepare Krabby Patties if he is in jail, he is struck with fear and he does everything he can to avoid coming within 15 feet of Squidward.\nSpongeBob resumes working, but unfortunately, the window from which SpongeBob gives orders to Squidward is within the 15 feet range, so the cash register and the counter are moved to the right, by the restroom door. SpongeBob tries to give the orders to Squidward by means of a pole, but Squidward ignores it. Mr. Krabs sees the restraining order is hindering business, so he removes SpongeBob's star and tells SpongeBob he has to think of another way.\nIn the next scene, Patrick is tiptoeing to Squidward. Squidward tries to ignore him, but it does not work. Patrick tries to tell Squidward he now has a hat. Mr. Krabs reveals that he hired Patrick as a middle man. Squidward will not stand it now that the employees are both his annoying neighbors, so he marches over to Mr. Krabs and complains to him. However, Mr. Krabs tells Squidward that unless he lifts the restraining order against SpongeBob, he will have to put up with Patrick, which annoys Squidward. SpongeBob prepares the food, then Patrick gives the order to Squidward.\nUnfortunately, Patrick asks Squidward if he can watch him work. Squidward says no, but Patrick continues to watch. Patrick does things that annoy Squidward, such as following him around the Krusty Krab, appearing inside the cash register, using the bathroom with him, and touching his hat. Squidward becomes very nervous that Patrick could appear any minute before he freaks when Mr. Krabs says his name and tells him it is time for his break. Squidward decides to play his clarinet. He opens his clarinet box to play, but it is not there. Patrick tells Squidward that he cleaned the bathroom, to which Squidward sarcastically tells him that he did well. But Patrick then tells Squidward that the \"toilet plunger\" is broken, as he used Squidward's clarinet to clean the toilets, angering Squidward. Mr. Krabs congratulates Patrick before telling Squidward his break is over. Squidward resumes work when a customer orders a lot of food, and asks if that is too much food, but Squidward tells him, \"That depends.\" The customer then says, \"On what?\", before Squidward tells him, \"How long do you wanna live,\" and laughs. Squidward then turns around to give Patrick the order, only to get his nose caught in Patrick's mouth. Squidward breaks free of Patrick, but gets flung across the restaurant. Patrick then finds a button on Squidward's post. A random fish appears with a seaberry pie, screams when he sees Squidward flying towards him and leaves the pie in midair. Squidward's face gets smashed into the seaberry pie, which causes him to suffer an allergic reaction by swelling.\nSquidward knows what he must do next. When Squidward is about to enter the kitchen, Patrick mistakes him for a monster and hears Squidward saying SpongeBob's name. Patrick thinks Squidward is going to hurt SpongeBob, so he attacks him. Seeing both of them fighting, SpongeBob wants to help, but is afraid of violating the restraining order and serving jail time. His desire to help his friends wins out, and he interferes in their fight and stops it. Patrick at this point finds out that the monster is Squidward, according to SpongeBob. He blames his button for not telling him. Squidward angrily takes the restraining order from SpongeBob, who begs him for mercy, to which Squidward tells him to hand him a pen. SpongeBob hands Squidward a pen and continues to cry before Squidward tells SpongeBob he is not going to jail. Instead of sending SpongeBob to jail, Squidward uses the pen to replace \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" with \"someone who's far more deserving.\" Patrick then says sorry to his button, before Squidward tells Patrick that he is on the restraining order, not his button. The episode ends with Patrick laughing hysterically."}
{"prompt": "Fiasco!", "completion": "The episode opens up with Patrick, dressed in a business suit, asking where can he get something to eat. Squidward walks in and tells him the answer is before him: the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs, dressed in a leotard, jumps out of the restaurant, and SpongeBob slides down a rainbow to his side. Squidward rides a dolphin while holding a plate of Krabby Patties, which Patrick eats. Suddenly, SpongeBob describes Patrick's actions.\nThen the scene turns to him and Mr. Krabs in front of a storyboard planned for a commercial. Mr. Krabs asks why he is in a leotard, and he says it is because he is the mascot. Mr. Krabs does not like this, so he tears up the storyboard, telling him he needs a \"masterpiece.\" Saddened, SpongeBob walks to Squidward's counter in depression and tells him about his problems, but Squidward does not care.\nAfter having seen a patron squirt ketchup and mustard onto a plate, Squidward looks at said plate and recognizes it as the art style of Fiasco. Although initially having planned to throw it away, Mr. Krabs, seeing an opportunity to make money, tries to take the artwork from Squidward, and they argue over who really owns it. Just then, Farfel Bainbridge, an art evaluator, comes in and declares the work to be authentic, and thereby a national treasure, thus meaning neither Mr. Krabs nor Squidward own it. Mr. Krabs allows people to view it in his restaurant for free (provided they order Krabby Patties, two each).\nLater, Plankton sees the artwork and mistakes it for garbage. Planning to reverse-engineer the recipe, he steals it. Police officers immediately chase him and dog him every step of the way. When he loses them, he is baffled as to why the police are chasing him, rather than Mr. Krabs.\nAt night, Plankton knocks on Patrick's rock, but when Patrick answers, he angrily tells him that he has a busy day of doing nothing the following day. Plankton then goes to SpongeBob's house and demands an explanation as to why the police are after him. SpongeBob explains that what he has stolen is, in fact, a priceless work of art. Plankton gets the idea to sell the artwork and declares SpongeBob and Gary to be accomplices to his crime. Gary is scared that he is going to be put in jail. Enraged by these accusations, SpongeBob confronts Plankton about this as they start to argue.\nSuddenly, Patrick storms in and furiously reminds Plankton that he wants some sleep as he is noticeably seen eating something. When SpongeBob asks what Patrick is eating, it is revealed that he ate the artwork, which he mistook for hors d'oeuvres, much to SpongeBob's and Plankton's horror. SpongeBob realizes that Patrick is eating the merchandise, with Plankton declaring him an accomplice as well. Suddenly, Squidward bursts in with the police and then lies to them about all of the noise. When they see Plankton, they immediately arrest him, along with Squidward for lying to them and also everyone else until they can figure this whole situation out. Finding himself arrested, Squidward tries to prove his innocence.\nAt the Bikini Bottom Police Department, Plankton and Squidward are locked away. Gary, Patrick, and SpongeBob are free since Mr. Krabs explained that they were not involved with the theft. Mr. Krabs starts crying, saddened that the Fiasco is now gone. However, since the artwork is now in Patrick's stomach, SpongeBob has an idea and Mr. Krabs has him stand behind an X-Ray machine, which shows the artwork inside him. Fiasco is moved by Patrick's style, stating that he will never paint again as he starts smashing all of his paintings in frustration. The episode ends with Squidward, who is still locked up, asking about his phone call."}
{"prompt": "Are You Happy Now?", "completion": "On a fine day at the Krusty Krab, Patrick is behind the restaurant climbing out of a dumpster eating a leftover Krabby Patty. The camera then pans over to SpongeBob, showing him reading The Krusty Krab Work Schedule, much to Squidward's chagrin. Squidward picks up the book SpongeBob was reading and questions on what is so great about it. SpongeBob then claims that the book has a list of \"his happiest memories.\" Squidward takes the book and \"accidentally\" drops it on the grill. However, SpongeBob has multiple copies of the book in a cabinet, and he proceeds to get another one. SpongeBob then asks Squidward if he has the happiest memory, in which he says, \"No.\" Feeling concerned, SpongeBob tries to ask Squidward if he can help make the happiest memory for him, which he accepts.\nFirst, SpongeBob takes Squidward to a concert; this does not go well, however, since the violin player accidentally shot Squidward in the eye with the violin bow. Then, both of them head to the Bikini Bottom Museum, where one of Squidward's masterpieces is in the museum and is being praised by critics. Squidward is happy until a famous art critic named Fiasco burns his artwork with a flamethrower. After that, SpongeBob takes Squidward on a hot air balloon ride. This does not go well, either, since Squidward is afraid of heights, so SpongeBob tries to get Squidward down by popping the balloon and both of them land on a mountain, which is actually Mount Bikini, ruining Harold's chance to be the first one on the mountain. Then, SpongeBob, Squidward, and Harold slide off the mountain due to an avalanche. When SpongeBob and Squidward slide back to their homes, Squidward sadly resigns that he will never have a happiest memory, let alone one involving SpongeBob.\nTwo weeks later, Squidward is left in his house doing nothing but being unhappy. SpongeBob then becomes even more concerned for Squidward and tries to get a hold of him, but to no avail. First, he and Gary go up to Squidward's window, but Squidward closes the curtains. SpongeBob suddenly falls off Gary along with Gary's shell, and SpongeBob gets stuck in the shell and breaks it when he crashes into Squidward's house. Second, he tries calling Squidward to cheer him up, but Squidward throws his phone into SpongeBob's house. Gary gives it to SpongeBob (while he is still holding his phone) and SpongeBob yells through the phone, making his ears hurt and breaking both phones. Then he comes out of Squidward's fax machine, but Squidward shreds him to pieces with his paper shredder and dumps him out the window, where Gary puts him back together.\nFinally, he traps Squidward in a box and takes him to the Krusty Krab, where he reveals that he created a party to try and cheer Squidward up. Unfortunately, SpongeBob failed to get anyone else to come, because they were either busy or sick, so instead, he made 100 papier-mâché life-sized models of himself. Squidward both hates seeing more than one sculpture of SpongeBob in one place and declares he never even wanted a \"happiest memory,\" so he goes berserk and destroys all the papier-mâché sculptures. Ironically enough, he gains pleasure from doing so and claims this to be his \"happiest memory,\" much to SpongeBob's own delight."}
{"prompt": "Planet of the Jellyfish", "completion": "The episode starts out with SpongeBob and Patrick catching jellyfish at Jellyfish Fields, when the latter says that if they would not sting, they would be perfect pets. Shortly after, a large alien jellyfish-like monster with large black eyes consumes a jellyfish, and then out of one of the tentacles spits a small pile of pink goo, which morphs into a Jellien, a jellyfish with large black eyes. Said Jellien is commanded to engulf someone as the Jellien King spits out more Jelliens. Patrick goes to take a nap, with the Jellien following him. As the former naps, the latter stretches out its body so that Patrick is inside of it, then one of its tentacles spits out a tall pile of pink goo, with morphs into Jellien Patrick, whom is Patrick but with large black eyes, same as the Jelliens. Patrick uses his blue mouth tentacles to pick up his net as SpongeBob catches the jellyfish. Jellies swarm into Jellien Patrick's net, and then Jellien Patrick gets an idea to turn everyone in town into Jellien people by giving them Jelliens.\nLater at night, SpongeBob and Jellien Patrick arrive at Squidward's house. Jellien Patrick stuffs his last Jellien into the latter's mail slot, then the jellien's tentacle spits out a tall light blue pile of goo from the window, which morphs into Jellien Squidward. Both Jellien Patrick and Jellien Squidward wish SpongeBob a good night. SpongeBob sleeps cozily in his bed as the Jellien that originally captured Patrick attempts to capture him, but SpongeBob awakes with insomnia. As he watches a horror movie, the Jellien tries to capture him again, but SpongeBob throws popcorn into the Jellien's mouth, and it starts choking on it, falling behind the couch.\nThe next morning, SpongeBob puts the Jellien into a cage as he leaves for work. It escapes, and consumes Gary as he sleeps, as well as the plant next to him. His tentacle spits out another small pile of goo, which reveals a Jellien Gary-plant hybrid. The scene switches to the Krusty Krab, which is completely filled with Jellien Bikini Bottomites, except for one normal fish. Said Jellien Bikini Bottomites order Krabby Patties but \"hold the mayonnaise\" until the non-Jellien orders a patty with extra mayonnaise. Jellien Mr. Krabs comes and says that they were \"out of the condiment called mayo\", and places a Jellien on his head. SpongeBob thinks that is weird, because the Krusty Krab had a fresh wall of mayo in the freezer. He then tells Jellien Patrick that he is getting mayo for the guy's patty. Patrick turns his head around, his torso still facing the grill, and yells \"No mayonnaise!\" Then his mouth tentacles consume the patty. SpongeBob goes to the freezer and grabs a box of mayo, then looks through the peephole. It shows everyone in town, minus Sandy, hibernating in transparent green cocoons hanging from the ceiling, as the Jellien King commands his Jelliens to do stuff for him, just like SpongeBob saw in the horror movie the night before.\nSpongeBob realizes that things are very wrong. He laughs nervously as he passes Jellien clone Patrick and is then ordered by Jellien Krabs to go home and take a nap. SpongeBob quickly flees from the Krusty Krab, with several Jellien Bikini Bottomites chasing him. Afterwards, he is grabbed by Sandy. The latter tickles him, and he giggles, showing that it is really him. They figure out that the Jellien's weakness is mayo since they ordered Krabby Patties with no mayonnaise (although Sandy already does not like mayonnaise). They then leave with sunglasses with lens that look like Jellien eyes. Unfortunately, when joking in front of Mr. Krabs's Jellien clone, SpongeBob elbows Sandy, knocking off her sunglasses, and Krabs's Jellien clone shouts \"imposters!\", which knocks off SpongeBob's sunglasses as well. The latter quickly grabs a mayo sprayer and defeats the entire town of Jellien clones. When a clone is destroyed, the real person of the clone awakens, and the cocoon they were held in disintegrates.\nAfter dealing with Jellien Patrick, who was the last one, SpongeBob and Sandy race to the Jellien King's hideout, containing everyone they know shivering in fear. SpongeBob destroys three of the Jellien King's jellyfish, but the mayo starts to freeze. He quickly throws the mayonnaise from the sprayer, but it freezes as well and lands in between the Jellien King's eye stems. Sandy quickly finishes the Jellien King by using the thermostat to turn up the heat, making the mayo quickly melt, destroying the Jellien King. The remaining Jelliens, that were not hit by mayo, then pop like bubbles. SpongeBob explains everything, which only took eleven minutes. Patrick tastes the jelly and compliments it as a relish. Soon, the goo remaining from the clones and Jelliens is served as Jelly Relish for $3 extra than regular Krabby Patties. Patrick then orders a Krabby Patty with Relish and then says \"Hold the mayo\". SpongeBob and Squidward hear this and look at Patrick in suspicion, and then the words \"The End?\" appear on the screen, ending the episode on a suspicious cliffhanger."}
{"prompt": "Free Samples", "completion": "Plotting to ruin Mr. Krabs, Plankton comes up with a \"new and original\" idea: giving out free samples. However, Karen points out this idea is not \"new and original\" at all. Plankton gives out free chum sticks to eager Bikini Bottomites, but not long after they eat his chum, they start to suffer from food poisoning. Plankton makes a run for it, and the sickened customers pursue him to the Chum Bucket, except for Patrick, who eats the chum and does not mind at all. Hiding from the furious mob. Karen points out that the people would never do this to Mr. Krabs if he gave out free samples, and Plankton gets an idea.\nHe sells Chum Burgers under the name \"Krabby Patties\" and gives them out for free, with the intent of smearing the Krusty Krab's name. However, when the customers become suspicious and one recognizes him as the same guy who made the rotten chum samples before, he quickly lies and tells the customers it was his brother-in-law \"Flankton,\" and they believe him. Sure enough, the customers get sick.\nWhen SpongeBob goes to the Krusty Krab, he sees an angry mob, mistaking it for a crowd of hungry and impatient customers. When he enters, he sees Mr. Krabs hiding behind a table, who explains that the customers have somehow turned on him and the Krabby Patties, and he cannot find out why. A brick is thrown through the window, wrapped in a piece of paper which says the Krabby Patties taste terrible. SpongeBob is shocked, and they realize they need to win their customers back. Mr. Krabs comes up with the idea to triple the prices, but SpongeBob says it is not a good idea, so Mr. Krabs decides to lower prices: by one cent. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs the only way to win them back is to give away free samples, which horrifies Mr. Krabs. When he realizes that no customers at all is worse than giving away free samples, he reluctantly agrees.\nSoon after, SpongeBob goes on the streets with a grill, ready to give away free Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs is having second thoughts, but SpongeBob chains him to heavy concrete blocks, telling Mr. Krabs that it is for his own good. SpongeBob announces his free goods, but nobody answers. SpongeBob uses his backup plan: playing a calliope with Squidward acting as the monkey. People are attracted to the sounds of the calliope, and Squidward in a monkey costume dances to a woman and a baby in a stroller. When the baby throws a coin at Squidward's head, he rips off his costume and leaves.\nWhen the people learn that SpongeBob is giving out free Krabby Patties, they are hesitant. Mr. Krabs laughs that even free is not good enough for them, then is horrified when he realizes how bad that is for business. He gives up and leaves. Plankton watches from afar, celebrating his accomplishment in ruining the Krusty Krab. However, SpongeBob refuses to give up and vows they will fix this, and when Mr. Krabs suggests he get a new job in a different way, he overhears \"new\" and \"different,\" and realizes how to win the customers back.\nSpongeBob tries a different approach: selling \"New\" Krabby Patties. This does not work at first, until a customer's hunger gets the best of him and he realizes he would rather take his chances than go hungry any longer. As soon as he takes a bite, he is instantly smitten with the Krabby Patty. He empties his pockets and asks how much it will get him. More people come to eat free samples, as well as paying extra, feeling the Krabby Patty is so good it should not be free. When Plankton hears the commotion, he walks over and gets upset.\nA truck dumps money on SpongeBob, as does a helicopter, which causes money to fly all around. One bill lands on Mr. Krabs' nose, and he runs to the stand. The two happily celebrate over saving the Krusty Krab and Mr. Krabs asks how he did such a thing; SpongeBob reveals he technically sold the real Krabby Patties, but under a new name with a different taste. Mr. Krabs then leaps into the pile of money, right on top of Plankton, and makes money angels. SpongeBob joins him, but they stop when they hear Plankton's high-pitched screams. Mr. Krabs asks what that noise was, but SpongeBob did not hear it. They resume making money angels as the episode ends."}

The phone rings and his secretary tells him that there is a call from SpongeBob. When the message is put through, Patrick hears SpongeBob calling for help. Then, he wakes up and goes to the pineapple. Squidward comes over after hearing the ruckus and SpongeBob tells him he could use his help. Patrick grabs his arms and wraps him around the pineapple.\nSpongeBob's arms are full, so he asks Patrick to call Sandy. However, with Patrick being his typical self, he fails to fully understand the problem, and he has small talk with her instead. When she hears part of the wall falling, she realizes that something is not right, so she goes to the pineapple. Mr. Krabs also comes over, asking what is going on, since SpongeBob is two hours late for work. They agree to help him, but Mr. Krabs will do it for one week of SpongeBob's wages per hour. They remodel the home as Gary continues to walk around with a can. Mr. Krabs and Sandy add their own flair to the house while remodeling it, both ignoring SpongeBob's protests. SpongeBob asks Gary, who is holding a can, if he ever feels like he is being ignored, and Gary assents.\nWhen the rebuilding is complete, SpongeBob is not happy with the changes. He explores his new home and sees Gary is still hungry, so he takes a can from a shelf (being held by Squidward's hands).

Patrick reveals that he has thrown the key for the chains into Glove Lake, where he states nobody will ever find it as he took SpongeBob's words seriously.\nSpongeBob falls silent with a blank expression on his face, after realizing that Patrick had stupidly trapped them at the Glove World! entrance. Because of this, SpongeBob does not answer when he is called out by Patrick, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Squiditis", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, Squidward fantasizes about being outside on a nice day, but in reality, he is stuck working at the Krusty Krab. While talking to SpongeBob, he then gets the idea to fake being sick to get away from him. He tells SpongeBob that he has a scratchy throat, a dry mouth, and an itchy eye. He dubs it as \"Squiditis\" and SpongeBob worries that he will catch it. He suggests that Squidward goes home to get better. Squidward goes to Mr. Krabs to tell him he is sick, so Mr. Krabs checks him out. He concludes that Squidward is fine and healthy, and then tells him to get back to work.\nWhen SpongeBob prepares to deliver an order, Squidward notices him wearing a gas mask. Squidward coughs into it, so SpongeBob panics. He goes to Mr. Krabs to tell him Squidward is sick, but Mr. Krabs is not convinced. He notices SpongeBob is acting odd, which is affecting business. He learns it is because he thinks Squidward is ill and is afraid to catch it. Then he suggests Squidward \"make him scarce.\" Squidward mirthfully leaves, and SpongeBob is relieved...until he notices his eye itches, his throat feels scratchy, and his mouth is dry. Using home remedies, SpongeBob soaks his feet in hot water, then freezing ice water, then boiling oil. Then he smears hot mustard onto his fried legs, which hurts. He plans to put cucumbers on his wounded legs, but only sees pickles. Concluding they are cucumbers, he dumps the pickles and their vinegar onto his legs. The vinegar burns his legs and he falls all over the place, into a pile of garbage. SpongeBob delivers an order while covered in garbage. The customers are turned off by the sickly employee and leave, prompting Mr. Krabs to tell SpongeBob to go home until he feels better. SpongeBob asks who will work while he is away, and Mr. Krabs boasts that he can do all the work blindfolded with one claw tied behind his back.\nSquidward lies on a beach chair, enjoying his break, when a garbage-covered SpongeBob comes along. Squidward is annoyed, and then goes into his house to at least enjoy himself inside. But SpongeBob goes in with him, and shows him a video tape with a romantic comedy on it. Squidward immediately gets angry at SpongeBob. At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is having a hard time fulfilling orders, and angers customers by throwing food at them and all over the place. Back at Squidward's home, the movie is over. But when SpongeBob says there are 99 more sequels to watch, Squidward cannot take it anymore and runs out, screaming. SpongeBob follows him to the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs lies on the ground, covered with Krabby Patty pieces, woozily telling SpongeBob that he could take care of everything. Noticing Mr. Krabs is not feeling good, SpongeBob presents him with the video tape of the romantic comedy. The episode ends with Mr. Krabs telling him to get away and runs away from him."}
{"prompt": "Demolition Doofus", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob is at boating school, and during the test, he continues to crash into the same two cars, inflating Mrs. Puff every time he continues to crash into an obstacle. Mrs. Puff then inflates so much, she sends the car airborne. SpongeBob then crashes the car into the lighthouse of the boating school, crippling Mrs. Puff for the rest of her life.\nIn the hospital, the doctor clarifies that Mrs. Puff's inflation sac (the part that pufferfishes use to puff up) was popped in the collision and she will not be able to \"puff\" again. SpongeBob's joke about her being crippled makes Mrs. Puff extremely angry and she begins grabbing his nose and threatening him, forcing him to apologize for his joke. She is tranquilized to stop her from hurting him. SpongeBob then begins to ramble and the doctor tranquilizes him as well, saying that everyone needs to take a nap.\nSpongeBob then visits Mrs. Puff with a bouquet of flowers along with the hundreds of other flowers he sent her, which she appears to be allergic to. After forcing her into a wheelchair, he pushes her down the hallway. Doctors are seen sprinting through the hallway with muscular men on the gurneys. SpongeBob stops the doctor and asks what is going on. He replies that the Demolition Derby members are about to battle in the hospital room, where they appear to be hitting each other with wheelchairs. The doctor says that they are brave to risk their lives for the community's entertainment. Mrs. Puff imagines them smashing into SpongeBob and killing him and begins laughing hysterically. Her laughing attracts SpongeBob's attention, and she claims she has a way for him to earn \"extra credit.\"\nMrs. Puff talks to derby manager Captain Lutefisk, asking him if she can enter SpongeBob. She shows him how much damage SpongeBob can do with a boat, though he is just using a steering wheel. Lutefisk says he is perfect for the derby and puts a sock on his head, giving him the title \"Le Squish.\" At the derby, SpongeBob is unaware of what he is supposed to do, which is to take out the opponents. Seeing him as an easy target, some competitors ram into him, but are unable to hit the car and are all hit by SpongeBob or destroyed in another way by the car. SpongeBob carelessly drives around everywhere, eliminating everyone.\nMrs. Puff is enraged at how SpongeBob is defeating the competitors only by serendipity. She then steals a tractor. She then starts to chase SpongeBob, trying to crush and kill him. She is unsuccessful as SpongeBob avoids her and all the cars are crushed before she breaks the wall and starts chasing him off-road. They then collide into the boating school after Mrs. Puff chases SpongeBob for a while. She somehow regains her \"puff,\" which SpongeBob notices and they get injured by the school, which the tower collapses and crushes them, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Treats!", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob watches a commercial at the Krusty Krab about a new snail treat, and he goes to the Pet Store to buy a box for Gary. At his house, SpongeBob gives Gary a Snail Bite. Gary likes the treat, so each time he does a trick, SpongeBob gives him a Snail Bite. Unfortunately, as time passes, SpongeBob runs out of treats, and Gary's hunger has yet to be fulfilled.\nGary meows all night for more Snail Bites, much to SpongeBob's chagrin. SpongeBob takes Gary to the pet store in the middle of the night to see if there are any more Snail Bites, to no avail. Later on, SpongeBob tries to leave for work, but Gary will not let him leave, so he tricks Gary into slithering towards the kitchen and runs for it.\nWhen SpongeBob goes to work, Gary enters the Krusty Krab to continue his ongoing plea for Snail Bites. Inspired by a customer's advice, SpongeBob and Gary go to the Snail Bites factory to see if they have any in stock. An employee tells SpongeBob and Gary that they are closed: the last box of Snail Bites shipped out days ago, they ran out of ingredients to make them, and the owner quit the business completely because his profit was fulfilled. Gary, still annoying him, tells SpongeBob that they should look all around the world to see if there are anymore Snail Bites, a plan that is eventually foiled by the exiguous amount of Snail Bites left on the world.\nSince SpongeBob now has no idea how to resolve this dilemma, Patrick promptly arrives and, after being told about the situation, tells SpongeBob that he should tell Gary \"No\" in a firm voice. SpongeBob is reluctant to confront Gary in such a blunt manner, but is encouraged when Patrick acts like a dog to prompt SpongeBob's firm refusal. At first, SpongeBob cannot do it, even while Patrick tells him to say it. However, once SpongeBob does say \"No,\" Patrick becomes upset and runs home crying from the pressure, despite the fact that he suggested it.\nAlthough with laborious effort, SpongeBob is finally able to turn down Gary's persistent plea for Snail Bites. Surprisingly, Gary accepts this and subsequently goes to bed. It is then revealed that Gary had learned his lesson about that doing another thing is more important than begging for a favorite thing the whole day. SpongeBob is surprised that all he had to do was say a simple no, leaving him wondering if Gary did all that to teach him a lesson as well.\nMeanwhile, it is revealed Patrick has the last known box of Snail Bites and is eating them in his rock. The episode ends with Patrick running out of Snail Bites and starting to persistently meow like Gary."}
{"prompt": "For Here or to Go", "completion": "At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is blowing a trumpet, heralding an important announcement from Mr. Krabs: it is the first annual bun seed counting contest. Anyone who correctly guesses how many seeds are in the sesame seed jar wins a free Krabby Patty. Several people make guesses, each more ridiculous than the last. The next contestant is Plankton, but before he can guess, Mr. Krabs grabs him by the antennae and takes him outside. Plankton claims it is unfair that he does not get to guess; however, Mr. Krabs says that he can do whatever he pleases and that he knew all Plankton would do is analyze the Krabby Patty to steal his secret formula. Mr. Krabs then chews Plankton up, inflates him, and blows him away, where he splatters onto the door of the Chum Bucket. Plankton calls the Bogus Business Bureau on him, but Mr. Krabs is unconcerned.\nAt the Krusty Krab, agents burst through the roof along with Agent Twirp, who tells Mr. Krabs he must accept guesses from all customers no matter how \"diminutive\" or \"annoying\" they are. Plankton pops out of Twirp's shirt pocket, proudly proclaiming he is both. Mr. Krabs is adamant about refusing to let him guess, but when Twirp threatens to close down the Krusty Krab, he reluctantly agrees. Plankton uses technology to scan the jar and guesses: 500,301. Mr. Krabs laughs at him, saying it is actually 500,300 \"and none.\" Agent Twirp interrupts and states that the contest is not official unless all the seeds are counted, and Mr. Krabs refuses until Twirp once again threatens to close down the Krusty Krab if he does not comply. Mr. Krabs painstakingly counts every single seed from the jar: 500,300. However, SpongeBob notices an uncounted seed in the jar's lid, and Plankton wins.\nDesperate to stall, Mr. Krabs makes excuses, but SpongeBob obliviously corrects him. Mr. Krabs says the contest included a free show, which Twirp allows. He constructs a puppet theater and performs a puppet show, but Plankton sees through the delay and continues to demand his Krabby Patty. Mr. Krabs realizes there is nothing else he can do, and sadly tells SpongeBob to prepare what could be his last Krabby Patty. Mr. Krabs has Squidward distract Twirp, giving him time to flush all the buns down the toilet, but a delivery man with buns that SpongeBob ordered thwarts his last-ditch efforts. This time SpongeBob realizes his error in unknowingly helping Plankton, as Krabs stares at him for understanding. When the Krabby Patty is ready, Plankton wants it \"to go,\" but Mr. Krabs says it must be \"dine in.\" Plankton stuffs the entire patty into his mouth, but Mr. Krabs tells him to swallow it. Once he does, he asks if he can go now, and is thrown out by Mr. Krabs into the Chum Bucket. In the Chum Bucket, Plankton climbs onto an operating table and tells Karen to remove the patty from his stomach right away, even declining anesthetic.\nLater, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob sadly watch the long line at the Chum Bucket. Suddenly, people rush out, sick from patties they say taste like stomach acid, aspirin, and carrots. The rest of the customers flee, and Plankton asks Karen what is going on. She tells him she followed his orders, revealing she focused on his stomach contents, rather than the Krabby Patty ingredients. Relieved, Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to recover the buns he flushed down the toilet and to put the seeds from the jar back onto them. SpongeBob ends the episode by saying \"That's my Krabs!\" and laughing."}
{"prompt": "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!", "completion": "As the special begins, Patchy the Pirate (parodying the role of S.D. Kluger from Santa Claus is Comin' to Town) drives a mail truck through a snowy mountain range. He stops to wish the viewers a Merry Christmas and tells them he wanted to make sure Santa Claus got his letter. He then lies saying he gave the mailman the day off, but it is revealed that he stole the truck and said mailman is tied up in the back.\nPotty the Parrot doubts they will make it to the North Pole, then argues with Patchy about which Christmas carol the directions to the North Pole are in. The truck is driven madly until Potty notices there is literally a fork in the road, which gets stuck in one of the tires and causes the truck to spin madly. Patchy then suggests that they see what SpongeBob is doing for the holidays.\nPatchy drives the truck off a cliff and the mailman escapes. He and Potty get lost in the woods (since the fork got stuck in one of the truck's tires and caused it to go flat, preventing them from being able to drive it any further) and are trying to warm up by a fire. Out of a sense of hunger, Patchy hallucinates and imagines Potty as a platter of buffalo wings. Patchy nearly eats his pet, only to snap out of it. Potty then also hallucinates and imagines Patchy's head as a suet cake topped with birdseed and pecks at it.\nAt the end of the episode, Patchy and Potty make it to the North Pole, believing they finally made it to Santa's workshop. Patchy apparently meets Santa in a cave and tells him his Christmas wish is to meet SpongeBob. However, it turns out he was, once again, hallucinating and really encountered a hungry polar bear, which started chasing him. Watching nearby, the real Santa puts Patchy on the naughty list for stealing a mail truck. He and Potty then end the episode wishing the viewers a Merry Christmas.\nSet to December 23, SpongeBob is really excited that Christmas is almost here. SpongeBob sees his friends are preparing for Christmas as well. Squidward is stringing lights so Santa knows to \"go away.\" Patrick has set a trap for Santa to make him stop the clocks so they will have Christmas all year long (but he gets trapped in his own trap). Sandy is conducting a Christmas scientific experiment. Mr. Krabs is ready for the season of \"getting.\" Meanwhile, Plankton is not happy, as he gets nothing but coal in his stocking every year, so he comes up with a new plan to ruin the holidays which involves the new element he recently discovered: a large green glowing chunk of what he dubs Jerktonium (Jt). His plan is to give out fruitcakes to everyone in town, each piece spiked with Jerktonium so that anyone who eats it will become a jerk. With everyone except him acting like a jerk, Santa will have no other choice but to put him on his nice list and give what he always wanted to get for Christmas: the Krabby Patty secret formula.\nDriving a fruitcake dispenser car called the \"Jerkmaker-9000,\" Plankton wonders who will be his first victim when SpongeBob shows up. After feeding him a piece of fruitcake and seeing that he did not become a jerk, Plankton thinks he got a piece that did not have Jerktonium, so he feeds SpongeBob more slices, then whole loaves, and even a baker's dozen, but there is still no effect. His plan having seemingly failed yet again, Plankton tosses SpongeBob the keys to the cake dispenser before kicking it and heading back into the Chum Bucket irritatedly. Driving the fruitcake dispenser up to a trio of Christmas carolers, SpongeBob gives them each a piece of fruitcake. Upon consuming it, they get enveloped in a green aura, grow five o'clock shadows and burly eyebrows, and begin arguing about which song to sing. Thinking they are just being passionate about the holidays, SpongeBob drives off to find more people to pass the fruitcake out to. Plankton, hearing the racket, comes out of the Chum Bucket and sees the carolers arguing, much to his delight. The Jerktonium works after all! Getting on a unicycle, Plankton follows after SpongeBob to see him unwittingly carry out his scheme.\nComing up to a Christmas parade in town, SpongeBob starts tossing fruitcake to everyone present: the spectators, the parade Santa, and even the driver of the parade float, totally unaware of the transformation everyone is undergoing. Plankton is pleased that soon, everyone in town will be jerks, except SpongeBob.\nConsulting Karen, Plankton discovers that SpongeBob's extreme purity-of-heart and innocent love of the Christmas holidays shields his heart from the effects of the Jerktonium, thereby making him immune. Knowing that SpongeBob still being on the nice list would likely ruin his plan, Plankton is forced to unleash \"Plan B\": an evil wind-up robot clone of SpongeBob, named \"ToyBob,\" to destroy Bikini Bottom and ruin SpongeBob's good name. The robot begins its campaign of naughtiness by throwing a boat into a building and trapping Mr. Krabs inside the Krusty Krab by burning down its sign.\nLater that day, as he returns from feeding fruitcake to everyone in Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob crosses paths with the carolers, who bad-mouth him. As SpongeBob passes the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs is (cheaply) fixing the sign, Mr. Krabs says that the repairs are coming out of his salary, thinking SpongeBob had destroyed the sign. Then he sees Patrick, who also became a jerk by setting another trap for Santa and tells SpongeBob to leave before falling in it again. The next morning, Christmas Eve, SpongeBob finally notices that everyone is being mean. Afraid that Santa might fly by Bikini Bottom, he asks Squidward for help, but Squidward (the only one in town who did not eat Jerktonium) claims he is not home, which SpongeBob immediately falls for and decides to go see Sandy on Squidward's suggestion. Right after SpongeBob leaves, ToyBob knocks (or more specifically, bumps) Squidward's door, and when he (still angrily) refuses to let ToyBob in, he grabs the door and smashes it on Squidward's head after he furiously demands ToyBob the door back.\nMeanwhile, SpongeBob goes to Sandy's treedome to explain, but she is also a jerk. SpongeBob accidentally drops some fruitcake Sandy had been eating into her Christmas Magic Analyzer, which shows that it is contaminated with Jerktonium. Sandy asks where SpongeBob got it from and he answers Plankton. Sandy asks again in disbelief that he would take the cake from the known-to-be evil Plankton and just hand it out to people without suspicion, to which SpongeBob stupidly says \"uh-huh.\" Sandy then explains to him that his foolish actions have caused the whole town to act mean; this causes SpongeBob to understand and get worried since he ate tons of Jerktonium. After discovering that SpongeBob is immune to Jerktonium but everyone else needs an antidote, Sandy sets her analyzer to come up with one. However, she cannot make sense of the formula notes. SpongeBob realizes that it is actually a music sheet. After SpongeBob recites some of the notes, Sandy instantly returns to normal, making SpongeBob realize the song is the antidote.\nGetting to the center of town, where everyone is having a riot, SpongeBob begins singing the song \"Don't Be a Jerk (It's Christmas).\" One by one, all the Bikini Bottomites become good and respectful again as they sing along (with Squidward later joining in despite still being a jerk himself).\nWith everyone else back to normal in not a moment too soon, SpongeBob happily says to Sandy that Santa should be there any minute, which Mr. Krabs verifies as, at that minute, Santa comes down from the sky on his sleigh. SpongeBob excitedly greets Santa, however, he is afraid to say that he is the bearer of bad tidings: the damage has been done and everyone in town is on the naughty list this year (with no buts about it). He ignores SpongeBob's attempt to explain the situation by declaring that everyone will get coal, except Plankton, much to everyone else's shock. Santa states that he is just as surprised as them, but compared to everyone else, Plankton has been a saint. Much to Mr. Krabs' astonishment, Santa gives Plankton the Krabby Patty formula as his present (before telling Mr. Krabs that he has his ways). Pearl then directs Mr. Krabs' attention to the elves who are in the process of picking his wallet from his pocket, making Mr. Krabs swat them away.\nStunned to see that his attempt to save Christmas has failed, SpongeBob stutters \"But-\" several times until Patrick slaps him to get him to talk clearly. SpongeBob tries to explain to Santa that he has it all wrong, but he refuses to listen by saying that SpongeBob (on the contrary) is the worst of all, believing that he is still wreaking havoc in Bikini Bottom.\nAt that moment, ToyBob arrives (much to Plankton's dismay) and, upon spotting Santa, carries out his programming to destroy Christmas by morphing into a larger form and eliminating him. SpongeBob tries to protect Santa, but is easily defeated when the robot throws him far away. Santa tries to hide in the Krusty Krab, but ToyBob captures him. SpongeBob saves Santa by using the fruitcake-dispenser to shoot fruitcake at it, clogging its vent holes and causing it to short circuit. SpongeBob manages to get Santa to safety just before ToyBob explodes into pieces. Santa thanks SpongeBob for saving him and tells him that he has been indeed a very good lad, unlike the \"owner of ToyBob.\" One of the elves gives Santa ToyBob's key, which is inscribed with \"If found, please return to the Chum Bucket,\" revealing to Santa that Plankton was responsible for all the trouble, enraging him. With that, Plankton attempts to escape with the Krabby Patty formula, only be stopped by Mr. Krabs, who calmly tells him to hand over his secret formula without making the situation become more worse. Mr. Krabs takes back the formula, tosses Plankton to Santa's Sleigh and Santa has the elves dump coals on Plankton as punishment for his actions, much to Plankton's horror. Santa then leaves everyone to celebrate the rest of the holidays (except Squidward). SpongeBob, looking around, asks if anyone has seen Patrick. The special then ends by showing Patrick on the back of Santa's sleigh and netting him, throwing him and the reindeer off course."}
{"prompt": "Super Evil Aquatic Villain Team Up is Go!", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob is walking down a sidewalk and singing on his way to work, when suddenly, he hears a crying sound. He looks down an alley, where Plankton is crying. He explains to SpongeBob that he was crying because one of his inventions backfired again. SpongeBob then asks what the device was, and Plankton says it was a doomsday device. However, it did nothing but spark and fall apart. SpongeBob suggests hiring a friend to fix it, so Plankton looks in the phone book and finds Man Ray, but it is under \"fiends\" instead of \"friends.\" Plankton does not care, so he meets Man Ray and explains the plan.\nThey then go to the Krusty Krab and demand the secret formula. When Mr. Krabs says that they will never get the formula of making Krabby Patties, Man Ray says that he thought it was a formula for world domination, but Plankton explains that if \"you control the fast food chain, you can control the world.\" Plankton then has Man Ray try a Krabby Patty to prove it, but Man Ray becomes addicted to them and demands more Krabby Patties without letting Plankton eat a single one. Meanwhile, SpongeBob tries to get Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy for help, but he fails many times. As he finally gets to them, he tells them, but they tell him that they cannot help him, leaving SpongeBob to be his own hero. SpongeBob then comes back to work to assist the tired Squidward and to \"be his own hero.\" He makes more Krabby Patties, in which Man Ray gets fat from. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy then come and arrest him, thus leaving Plankton to pay the bill for the Krabby Patties, and the episode ends with Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Squidward all having a big laugh."}
{"prompt": "Chum Fricassee", "completion": "After a long day of work, SpongeBob is shown upset about clocking out and ends up leaving before doing so. Squidward clocks them both out and begins to contemplate the surroundings of the Krusty Krab, only to find that he thinks it is disgusting, and that it has no doormat. Mr. Krabs, as usual, dismisses his comments as complaints and claims that Squidward would have no true experience on how to run his own restaurant. Squidward then retaliates by saying that if he started a restaurant, people would be waiting for years just to have a taste of his cooking. Mr. Krabs laughs at this statement as SpongeBob and Squidward depart from the Krusty Krab. Squidward continues his boasting and claims that with his cooking abilities, he can even make the Chum Bucket a success and make people come dine there.\nPlankton overhears this statement and rushes out of the Chum Bucket. He tries to grab Squidward's attention by hooking on to Squidward's skin near his scalp. Squidward pries Plankton off and initially refuses his offer, but when Mr. Krabs passes by and flat-out says that he does not value him, Squidward accepts. Squidward tells SpongeBob that he is quitting his job at the Krusty Krab and enters the Chum Bucket. SpongeBob is left shocked at this.\nThough Squidward immediately jumps to decorating the Chum Bucket, Plankton reminds him that he hired Squidward to cook. Squidward pours a batch of chum into a large container. He claims that he can make even chum edible with his grandmother's secret recipe, yet it will take exactly 24 hours to cook. After 24 hours, Squidward places a plate of the chum on a plate for Plankton. Plankton is not amused at first, since the chum looks the same, but notes that it does not smell unpleasant. After tasting it, he claims he loves it.\nThe chum leads to the opening of a new restaurant using Squidward as the chef and the same structure of the Chum Bucket. The restaurant is called Le Chum Bucket and the chum is called \"Chum Fricassee,\" prepared only by Squidward. Squidward becomes a big hit while the Krusty Krab appears to have no customers. At first, what looks like a customer at the Krusty Krab is later revealed to be a customer from the Le Chum Bucket. He was at the Krusty Krab because the Le Chum Bucket was full of customers. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs sneak into the Le Chum Bucket as fancy customers, as they assume only fancy people dine there. Once they gain entry, Mr. Krabs warns SpongeBob that these are classier people and do not raise their voice as SpongeBob does. When they approach the reservation desk with Karen as the reservation seeker, Mr. Krabs makes up a fake alias to gain entry as \"Mr. Crumbled O'Wrapper.\" Karen does not see a reservation for a Sir Crumbled O'Wrapper, yet she does offer a reservation and seat within two years, which angers Mr. Krabs. Squidward enters the scene and annoyingly asks Karen what the problem is, but after seeing SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs in disguises, he fans their moustaches and reveals their true identities to everyone. He gets revenge on Mr. Krabs for his earlier treatment by taking them to the bathroom, where he places a tablecloth on the toilet rim, calling them suckers and gives them \"Bon Appetite,\" in a very sarcastic tone, making the entire restaurant laugh at them.\nHumiliated and miserable, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs leave while Plankton mocks them with his fortune and the pair are left on the side of the street, with Mr. Krabs sobbing and SpongeBob comforting him. Meanwhile, in Le Chum Bucket, Squidward is signing autographs when he sees a long line of customers and asks Plankton where the next batch of Fricassee is. Plankton reminds him that the chum needs to be cooked for 24 hours, and the timer on the cooker says that there is still one hour remaining. Squidward simply declares that he does not care if the chum is not ready and orders Plankton to serve it to the customers anyway. Back outside, a fish who had ordered take-out chum sees SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs and gives it to them out of pity. SpongeBob tries some of it, and, seeing it tastes so good, forgets what a Krabby Patty is. Mr. Krabs also takes a bite and decides that they are doomed because of how delicious it tastes and bawls in misery. \nThe success of Le Chum Bucket eventually gets to Squidward's grandmother, Grandma Tentacles, much to her dismay. She is enraged at Squidward for cooking the recipe incorrectly, using her walker to smash Squidward's foot several times. Squidward lies and say that it was Plankton's idea to serve the undercooked chum. However, Plankton is not having it and throws the blame back at Squidward by reminding him how he told him that he did not care if the food was ready or not. Squidward admits this, still not seeing the big deal. After smashing Squidward's foot again, Grandma Tentacles explains that if the chum is not properly cooked for exactly 24 hours, it will cause severe stomach issues. This enrages the customers, who are prompted by Grandma Tentacles to destroy and burn down Le Chum Bucket in retributions, leaving both Plankton and Squidward devastated. Grandma Tentacles reappears, angrily stating to her scared grandson that she hopes that he learned his lesson about misusing her recipe and stomps in his foot again for his wrongful acts. Squidward and Plankton cry over their failures in pain and despair. \nSpongeBob and Mr. Krabs admire the events of the destroyed Chum Bucket. Mr. Krabs has learned his lesson and decides to rehire Squidward. He promotes him to be their new doormat, while Squidward is in pain, but is pleased with customers stepping on him, ending the episode."}
{"prompt": "The Good Krabby Name", "completion": "One day, Mr. Krabs is shown looking through a telescope on the top of the Krusty Krab, spying on customers and taking pictures of any Bikini Bottom residents. He then enters the restaurant and calls SpongeBob and Squidward into his office. He shows them the pictures of the customers and asks SpongeBob if he has seen any of them inside the Krusty Krab. They both answer in the negative and Mr. Krabs then tells SpongeBob and Squidward that two percent of the residents of Bikini Bottom have not set foot in the Krusty Krab, which means that two percent of money is not being earned. He tells them that he wants them to go out and promote the restaurant, but only SpongeBob is willing while Squidward stays at the Krusty Krab.\nThe next scene, SpongeBob is shown coming out of a giant hole at the top of the Krusty Krab wearing a Krabby Patty costume and jumping off of a giant spatula. He asks a random fish if he has heard of the Krusty Krab, and he tells SpongeBob that he is just about to enter the restaurant. The man takes flyers that SpongeBob is offering about the Krusty Krab and leaves. Patrick is then shown watching SpongeBob, whom he believes to be evidence of the \"invasion of the giant patties\" from behind a giant rock. He then lunges out at his friend and tries to eat him. After realizing it is just him, Patrick makes sure that SpongeBob is okay, and SpongeBob tells him of his job to promote the Krusty Krab. Patrick tells SpongeBob that he needs an even bigger advertisement blitz.\nPatrick is then shown shaving the message \"Eat at the Krusty Krab\" on SpongeBob's back, and painting the message on the walls with black paint. SpongeBob is then used to stamp the message all over downtown. Patrick tells SpongeBob that he had hired a skywriter, but the skywriter falls out of the plane, holding a clipboard that says \"Help me,\" and crashes onto the edge of a cliff. A scout leader and three campers are then shown, on a tour of the oldest tree in Bikini Bottom. However, the tree falls over when Patrick creates the advertisement out of its leaves.\nSpongeBob is then shown exiting a bathroom stall and telling a man that they had left a present for him. The man walks into the stall and sees that \"Eat at the Krusty Krab\" is written on every sheet of toilet paper. Patrick is then shown flying a plane with a banner advertisement in back, and SpongeBob is shown flying a blimp. Patrick almost crashes into SpongeBob, but somehow the blimp avoids the plane. They soon collide, however, and both fall to the ground, screaming.\nSuddenly, a cellphone is heard ringing inside of Patrick's pocket, and it turns out to be Mr. Krabs, calling them and telling them that their advertisement campaign is working well, and that the Krusty Krab is packed, as well as that some of the customers who had never previously entered the restaurant are now there. Squidward is shown cooking the patties as well as taking many orders. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Patrick to continue doing what they have been doing and to try to find the last one percent, which they are unsure of how to find. They realize that they did not advertise over a highway of boats, so they go there. Patrick turns into a traffic cone and makes a truck stop, and \"Eat at the Krusty Krab\" is then painted on the truck's side by SpongeBob.\nAfter causing a massive crash, the two then go back to the Krusty Krab to tell to Mr. Krabs they made it, and the crashed cars' drivers are seen charging into the Krusty Krab. He and Patrick try their best to hold the door, but Mr. Krabs welcomes them in.\nAs the customers are breaking the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs grabs one of the last customers and brings him to the top of Krusty Krab to give him a Krabby Patty. He voices his approval of the campaign and the Krusty Krab completely collapses right after, as the episode ends."}

Both Mr. Krabs and Plankton think this is suspicious and step out of their restaurants to this employee. After the state officer assures himself that the people standing next to him are Eugene Krabs and Sheldon Plankton, he claims the signs are for them. The sign claims that there is now a law that states that two restaurants cannot be within 100 feet of each other.\nAfter hearing that one of their restaurants will be bulldozed if the action is not carried out, Mr. Krabs and Plankton simultaneously measure with measuring tape the distance between the restaurants. It is revealed that their restaurants are exactly 99 feet away, and they have a dispute on whose restaurant is being bulldozed. The employer assures them that they have 24 hours to make that decision. After further disputing, Plankton decides to start a petition in order to save the Chum Bucket, while Mr. Krabs does the same in order to save the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs hands Squidward and SpongeBob petition forms for people to sign. SpongeBob loves the idea, and even signs his name first, while Squidward disappears, leaving his petition on the floor.\nSpongeBob heads to Mrs. Puff's classroom, where she is startled at the sight of him. He asks her if she would sign the petition, only for her to question why she would do such a thing. A shipping man walks into the classroom and claims that Mrs. Puff's new boat has arrived. SpongeBob asks the shipping man if he would sign the petition as well, only for him to ask the same question as Mrs. Puff. The shipping man unloads the new boat seconds after, only for SpongeBob to put the car in reverse and for it to crash into the classroom. SpongeBob spots a police officer later on the street and asks him if he would sign the petition. He firmly disagrees and hands SpongeBob a flyer stating that Krabby Patties are dangerous. SpongeBob, knowing that this is the work of Plankton, heads to the Krusty Krab, only for an angry mob disputing at Mr. Krabs. Nat Peterson questions why Krabby Patties are dangerous, only for Mr. Krabs to stutter in his reply.\nSpongeBob saves him by bringing out a batch of Krabby Patties and stating they are dangerous due to them being so delicious. The mob calms down from their rage and eats the Krabby Patties. Plankton decides to accept fate and says \"goodbye\" to his inventions. SpongeBob arrives and cries with Plankton, for he feels that a part of this demolition of the Chum Bucket is somewhat his fault, since he makes the Krabby Patties so delicious. SpongeBob, in his weeping, gives Plankton an idea to give people money to make them sign his petition. Karen reassures him that they are 372 dollars in debt, but Plankton extends the idea. Mr. Krabs then uses his telescope to spy on the Chum Bucket, for it seems Plankton is receiving an abundance of money.\nIt is shown that Plankton is having a yard sale to make money, yet then he uses said money and sells it for free only if people sign the petition to save the Chum Bucket. Mr. Krabs, angered at the idea, has to accept fate and tells SpongeBob to pack up his belongings in the Krusty Krab. The state officer returns with a bulldozer to bulldoze a restaurant.\nPlankton shows he has a majority of the people in Bikini Bottom on his petition, so the state officer has no choice but to bulldoze the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob chain themselves to the restaurant, except for Squidward, who is at home enjoying a glass of lemonade. The state officer gives Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob two chances to move, yet they refuse. He then begins to move the bulldozer forward, while Plankton pulls up a seat, watching over. The state officer turns out to only push the Krusty Krab backwards and measures the distance he moved the restaurant, being exactly one more foot. \nPlankton is enraged and questions why he saw no destruction. The state officer responds he only wanted to make sure the restaurant met the requirements of the new law. Plankton, in his fit of rage, becomes stuck in his foldable chair. SpongeBob is reassured that the Krusty Krab will not be shut down and then proceeds to hop into the bulldozer, hugging the state officer so much that he is unaware he set the bulldozer in reverse.\nThe bulldozer smashes through the Chum Bucket and Plankton is finally able to escape from the chair and sees his restaurant destroyed. He then places himself back into the foldable chair so he does not have to see the restaurant in its smashed remains, ending the episode."}
{"prompt": "Hello Bikini Bottom!", "completion": "The episode starts with Squidward deciding to play his clarinet. SpongeBob overhears him and decides to join him by playing his ukulele. They both play back and forth until Squidward blows his clarinet out of his mouth, then tells SpongeBob that he will never play with him. A stylish fish claps for them liking SpongeBob and Squidward's performance and Squidward asks who the fish is. The fish introduces himself as Colonel Carper. Colonel says that he wants to be SpongeBob and Squidward's band manager and that they will make a lot of money.\nHowever, Mr. Krabs overhears money being involved and forcefully makes himself SpongeBob and Squidward's band manager. He even manages to steal tips from Carper on what a band needs: A tour bus, venue, sound equipment, and roadies. Mr. Krabs steals Mrs. Puff's busmobile and drives back to the Krusty Krab, then he takes off his speaker, checking off both having a tour bus and sound equipment. At the moment, all he needs is a roadie, in which, he sees Patrick entering the Krusty Krab holding a boat and makes him the roadie.\nMr. Krabs, Squidward, SpongeBob, and Patrick all travel to a building that hosts the appearance of Ned and the Needlefish. Mr. Krabs meets up with Colonel Carper again, and Carper explains how much better he is doing. He then blasts on Mr. Krabs for having poor sound equipment and a roadie. He also manages to even blow up Mr. Krabs' sound equipment by telling him his service will be free.\nIn the next scene, when Squidward is playing his clarinet on the microphone, Mr. Krabs' \"sound equipment\" explodes. Carper then breaks down laughing, not knowing Mr. Krabs was stealing his sound equipment from behind him. Mr. Krabs then drives the gang to their first gig: a supermarket. Squidward complains about the place they are playing at and demands Mr. Krabs to drive back to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs says it is impossible because he sold the Krusty Krab to a Pawn Shop, much to SpongeBob's dismay. Even Squidward thinks that was a bad idea. Plankton is seen walking past the Pawn Shop and spots the Krusty Krab. He then runs home going to get his money.\nSquidward and SpongeBob finally begin to play at the Supermarket, and all of the other customers even start using food items to play along with the beat as well. Once Squidward and SpongeBob stop playing, all of the customers leave, which Squidward dislikes. The Supermarket Manager then bills Mr. Krabs for playing at his supermarket. Mr. Krabs then takes the gang to a retirement home, and he manages to convince Squidward to play there. However, every time that SpongeBob and Squidward play, an elderly fish keeps yelling out \"Too loud!\", even if SpongeBob and Squidward are not playing. The next gig ends up at a child's birthday party and the act finishes after the gig ended soon when a kid playing a game sticks Squidward.\nAct 2 begins as Mr. Krabs drives to the next destination. Squidward says that if the next gig is anything like the others, he will quit. When Mr. Krabs stops at the Electronics Outhouse, Squidward attempts to leave off the bus, but Mr. Krabs slams the door on his face, saying that it is not their next gig. Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Squidward all look toward a large crowd heading toward a stadium, and Mr. Krabs says that is their next gig (which says \"Ned and the Needlefish Today!\"). Mr. Krabs drops off SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick and goes back to the \"Next Town\" sign and starts to do work on it. It turns out that he made it redirect Ned and the Needlefish to the Electronics Outhouse, in which, the band drives to with Ned thinking that they really have gone downhill.\nMeanwhile, SpongeBob and Squidward are preparing to perform for the crowd. The curtains open up, and the entire crowd is cheering. However, Squidward notices they are chanting for Ned and the Needlefish, but SpongeBob thinks that the crowd is cheering for them instead. As the lights turn on, the crowd notices that they are not Ned and the Needlefish. Squidward says that they know what they came for and he and SpongeBob start playing, but the crowd (with Harold actually giving the signal) begins to chase them off the stage. As the duo are being chased away, Ned and the Needlefish are performing at the Electronics Outhouse. Bert asks Ned about something, but Ned tells him that one of his band members could help him instead. Back at the stadium, Colonel Carper returns, and he is furious at Mr. Krabs for stealing his sound equipment and for driving Ned and the Needlefish off course.\nCarper tells Mr. Krabs that he is suing him for everything he has got and has his roadies take back his sound equipment and even tag \"Losers\" on Mr. Krabs' tour bus. Mr. Krabs is highly depressed as he drives again, with Squidward saying things have gotten worse. Mr. Krabs breaks down in tears and ends up driving off a cliff with the bus tumbling many times but only suffering a flat tire. Mr. Krabs asks for Patrick to put up the spare, but Patrick ended up eating it (which Squidward actually guessed correctly). SpongeBob pulls out a small bag of tires telling Patrick he would have given him one. Squidward gets fed up with everything, not even caring if Mr. Krabs goes broke and decides to walk off but walks into a series of cacti along the way. SpongeBob tries to convince Squidward to stay, but he will not budge and walks off into the sunset.\nSpongeBob then starts to sing about not giving up and eventually, Squidward turns back around, and he and SpongeBob play for the final time on top of the bus. They notice a crowd cheering with Mr. Krabs in shock; however, Patrick says that they are only cheering for the rare meteor shower that was going on. Mr. Krabs then sets up an admission stand to have people pay to see the meteor shower and makes all of his money back.\nUnfortunately for Mr. Krabs, there is a long line of fish waiting to get paid back from Mr. Krabs, which includes Mrs. Puff, the Supermarket Manager, and even Colonel Carper. Carper asks for the rest of Mr. Krabs' money for using his equipment, causing him to lose profits from the Needlefish show, damages to his property, and the rest just because he wants it. Mr. Krabs, of course, refuses. Carper then has his roadies dump all of Mr. Krabs' money into his pants, then drops him onto the ground. Mr. Krabs, along with SpongeBob, is outside the Pawn Shop and is sad that he will never get his Krusty Krab back. Fortunately for him, SpongeBob offers Mr. Krabs a piggy bank of Gary's college fund, which he grabs without hesitation and he buys back the Krusty Krab and puts it on his boat. Mr. Krabs drives off with SpongeBob. Plankton arrives shortly after with a wagon of money, wanting to buy the Krusty Krab. However, the Pawn Shop Owner tells Plankton that he just sold it but has a taco stand instead. Plankton looks on with a shocked look on his face, closing the episode."}
{"prompt": "Extreme Spots", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob and Patrick are at Sand Mountain. They see Johnny Krill, Not Dead Ted, and Grand Maul Granny, The Drastic Radicals, doing extreme sports. A British fancy fish tells them about them, and because he spoke in lisp, they mistake it for \"extreme spots.\" A jellyfish lands on Patrick and he gets covered in jellyfish sting spots. They stand in front of the team, wanting to join them because of spots. Johnny corrects them, stating he meant \"sports,\" not \"spots,\" and lets them try to be Drasticals.\nHe shows SpongeBob a motorbike. SpongeBob tries to climb on, but the motorbike starts and it rips his arms off. His arms drive away on the motorbike whilst SpongeBob tries to catch up. SpongeBob is about to give up when the motorbike comes back at him. The motorbike stops in front of Johnny Krill.\nOn the hill above them, Patrick gets pushed by Granny down the hill on a clamboard. Patrick swallows the board and hits a lot of rocks. Once at the bottom, SpongeBob and Patrick walk over to Johnny Krill and his team. Johnny decides that his sports are too extreme for SpongeBob and Patrick. So SpongeBob tells Johnny they can jump rope while Patrick is playing double Dutch. Patrick sings a song, then he falls out when he finds out it was exercise and SpongeBob says \"extreme.\" Johnny Krill shows them extreme as Ted jumps fast, hits a plane, falls down, and blows up burned. Johnny says that sports have to be explosive. So, SpongeBob blows a bubble and he and Patrick mimic the booms, but they are not impressed. Johnny says it has to be big and he shows it by riding his motorcycle through a huge bubble wand and ride in a bubble through town and landing on a heavy industry. SpongeBob asks if fighting is extreme and Johnny says fighting is \"totally extreme.\"\nSpongeBob boxes a pillow, but does not do so well. Unimpressed, Johnny shows them, by hitting the pillow hard and taking it to the cleaners. However, the mattress soon beats up Johnny. Johnny asks if they do any more sports and SpongeBob says Patrick is an expert at dumpster diving.\nPatrick climbs on top of the dumpster and falls face flat on the garbage. Johnny says it is not extreme, but when Patrick brushes his teeth with a rotten toothbrush, he admits that that act may be extreme. Granny lands on the garbage at a high height, gets in a garbage truck, gets crunched up into a garbage cube, and emerges unharmed. Johnny asks if they do any other sports, and SpongeBob says there is one sport if they are up to it: jellyfishing. While they are doing it, the Drasticals catch jellyfish while doing extreme.\nLater, the team gets injured and covered in jellyfish stings, saying that the spots are way extreme. The fancy fish returns and says the extreme spots are the direct product of extreme sports. Everyone looks at him confused, as Patrick asks, \"Who is that guy?,\" as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Squirrel Record", "completion": "During the evening at the Krusty Krab, Squidward is sleeping at the cash register until Squidward's clock starts ringing, which causes him to wake up and stop the clock ringing with his hand. Squidward then pokes his head in the kitchen window and yells at SpongeBob to go home since it is quitting time. SpongeBob is obliviously not paying attention to anything Squidward is saying. Immediately, SpongeBob's watch beeps and notices that it is quitting time. He asks Squidward why he is still here. When Squidward hears this and sees where he is, he screams in frustration and runs out of the Krusty Krab. Still in the kitchen, SpongeBob does not want to throw away a cooked patty, so he puts the patty in his wallet and saves it for later. SpongeBob then smells garbage and decides to take out the trash. While dumping the trash into the dumpster, SpongeBob notices a book covered in garbage and claims \"You shouldn't throw away books.\" Suddenly, SpongeBob sees a big green slimy monster emerging from the dumpster. SpongeBob then throws the book at it, causing the slimy monster to fall over. The slime dissolves to reveal that it was actually Sandy. Sandy claims that she is was just trying to break the record for rooting around in a trash bin. Sandy shows SpongeBob the book he was holding is called The Guinness O'Ripley Enormous Book of Curiosities, Oddities, and World Records. She then shows SpongeBob some of the world records in the book and claims she wants to beat every record in that book.\nThe scene cuts to Sandy's Treedome, where SpongeBob and Sandy try to break the record for world's longest tongue. Sandy holds her hand on her door while SpongeBob pulls on Sandy's tongue. The record is broken after SpongeBob stretches her tongue up to 110 inches. The next record is to eat raw chum, so SpongeBob and Sandy go to the Chum Bucket and ask Plankton to give them raw chum. Plankton, however, warns them that no one can ingest raw chum and survive, but SpongeBob and Sandy do not care. Later in Sandy's Treedome, SpongeBob wears a special germ suit and gives Sandy a spoon of raw chum. Sandy then swallows it and freaks out. SpongeBob tells Sandy that she survived and broke the record. However, Sandy suddenly becomes subconscious from eating the raw chum. SpongeBob then takes off his water helmet and feeds Sandy the patty in his wallet he saved from work. Sandy recovers from her subconscious and says \"I can't wait to show them experts the pictures of my record-breaking feats.\" SpongeBob suddenly realizes that he forgot his camera, and he goes home to get it.\nWhen SpongeBob returns, he sees Sandy's treedome filled with a bunch of robots. Sandy comes up to SpongeBob and asks him to take a picture of her throwing a woodchuck to break the woodchuck chuckin' world record. SpongeBob takes the photo of Sandy throwing a woodchuck and she breaks the record. Sandy at that occasion sends the woodchucks back to where they belong. Afterward, SpongeBob asks Sandy, \"What is all this?\" Sandy explains that she had constructed many robots to help keep track of her records and with careful planning and precise delegation of appropriate tasks so that she can manage the successful completion of the maximum number of records broken in the least amount of time. Sandy takes the picture of her throwing a woodchuck from SpongeBob and places it in the book. Sandy flips the page of the world records book to see what is next. The next record is the world's longest tooth. Sandy then asks one of the robots how the calcium fusion is going. The robot replies, \"It is ready, Miss Cheeks.\" Sandy administers the shot and her tooth grows. It continues to grow until she hits her head on the ceiling of the treedome. The robot uses a tape measure and reaches 35 feet, which breaks the record. SpongeBob takes a picture and tells Sandy to say \"Cheese!\" Sandy saws a giant part of the tooth off her top tooth and slides down.\nThe next record is spiciest chili gargle. So, Sandy gargles on chili as SpongeBob takes a picture. Sandy gulps the spicy chilly and breathes out fire at SpongeBob. The next record is largest rubber band ball. SpongeBob takes a picture of the large rubber band ball as Sandy lets go of it, and SpongeBob gets crushed. The record after that is most cobras milked. SpongeBob takes a picture of Sandy milking the cobras. After that, the next record is most walnuts in mouth. Sandy gets a lot of walnuts in her mouth, SpongeBob takes a photo, and Sandy spits out the walnuts. After that record, the next one is most chainsaws juggled. The scene cuts to Sandy juggling chainsaws, with robots giving her more to juggle. SpongeBob takes a picture of her juggling the chainsaws and asks, \"How do you stop?\" To answer his question, Sandy stops juggling chainsaws and then runs like heck. However, SpongeBob accidentally gets cut into pieces by chainsaws because he ran the wrong way. SpongeBob puts himself back together and says \"It is getting kinda dangerous.\"\nSandy then takes SpongeBob and herself outside the treedome and shows SpongeBob the world's largest house of cards. Sandy and SpongeBob go up to the top of the house of cards so that they can take a picture. Meanwhile, Patrick is walking along and sees the house of cards is made with Solitaire cards. Patrick comes back with a baseball bat and hits the house of cards, causing the world's largest house of cards to collapse as SpongeBob and Sandy scream when they fall from the top. Thereupon, SpongeBob tells Sandy that he can smell Gary's sandbox and goes home to clean it.\nThe scene changes to SpongeBob's house, where SpongeBob is cleaning Gary's litter box. While cleaning the litter box, SpongeBob tells Gary that he has broken the record for \"World's Stinkiest Litter box.\" SpongeBob finds that Sandy has become obsessed with the record book and claims that the book must be destroyed. SpongeBob goes back to Sandy's treedome and disguises himself as one of Sandy's robots so he looks like the rest of the robots. SpongeBob then asks one of the robots if he can hold on to the record book, and the robot gives the book to him. Sandy does not recognize SpongeBob's robot disguise, and she puts him into a line where robots are getting destroyed to break the record for most robots built and destroyed in a day. While the robots are getting built and destroyed, a robot standing next to Sandy is counting the total amount of destroyed robots in order to break the world record. In the line of robots getting built and destroyed, SpongeBob in his robot disguise tries to sneak out of the line, but one robot grabs him and says \"We're all in this together.\" SpongeBob and the robot both get crushed and are sent though a conveyor belt. Sandy finally breaks the most robots built and destroyed in a day. One of the robots comes out of the robot destroying the machine and says his stomach feels funny. Sandy looks inside his stomach and sees SpongeBob.\nThe robot pukes out SpongeBob, and SpongeBob states he came to save her from the record book. Sandy says she is done with the book and she has beaten every record. A man who works for the book's company comes to see what Sandy has done, but reveals that she has not actually broken any records. He explains that the book Sandy has was published thirty years earlier, so all the records in it had already been broken (several times over probably). However, the man adds that SpongeBob has set a new record: getting so many injuries from helping a friend. SpongeBob cracks into pieces and the author takes a picture, as the episode ends."}

When he opens the door, he encounters a sad Patrick, who runs in his house crying and reveals that he is jealous of SpongeBob's special work hat. SpongeBob suggests that Patrick preoccupies his mind with something else, to no avail; he then heads off to the Krusty Krab. Patrick then sits down and watches television, but only flips through channels. He then stops on a channel with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, with them defeating Man Ray. Patrick turns off the TV and wonders what to do with his life. He then steps on a talking Mermaid Man doll and is thereupon inspired to become a superhero. He goes to the kitchen and creates his costume.\nMeanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is angry at Squidward for doing nothing. Squidward then points out the empty dining room. Mr. Krabs is worried, but then, Patrick-Man enters the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is excited to see Patrick, but the latter tells him that he is Patrick-Man. His new alter-ego results in ridicule from Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and SpongeBob. Patrick explains to SpongeBob that he has found his calling and is now \"Patrick-Man.\" SpongeBob is excited and thinks about telling everyone else, but Patrick-Man tells him that his identity must remain a secret.\nAt the Bikini Bottom High School, two students show off their papers, both making \"A's.\" Patrick-Man overhears them laughing, and when they are about to give each other a \"high-five,\" Patrick-Man interferes and accuses them of igniting violence.\nThe scene changes over to Mr. Krabs about to walk Incidental 82 across the street. However, he spots a dollar on the ground, but then it gets blown away to the other side of the street. Mr. Krabs leaves Incidental 82 on the street to go after the dollar, with her trapped by the driving cars. He goes to pick up the dollar, but Patrick-Man stops him and accuses him of trying to steal the dollar before heading off.\nPatrick-Man's next stop is at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, where he spots Mrs. Puff trying to get the door off a boat which one of her students is trapped in. He thinks Mrs. Puff is trying to break into the boat and frames her for breaking and entering, prompting the authorities to arrive on the scene and arrest her, with the student still trapped in the car.\nBack at the Krusty Krab, Patrick continues to suspect evil and causes mayhem at the restaurant. Intolerant of his recent behavior, SpongeBob goes to confront Patrick about his superhero persona, but Patrick does not take his advice into consideration and continues his disruption, hoping to unmask a villain. He first tries to pull off Fred's head, to no success. He tries again with two other customers, but causes them to leave. This makes Mr. Krabs very upset and prompts him to nearly kick Patrick out, until he pulls off Mable's head and unmasks the Dirty Bubble.\nThe Dirty Bubble tells them how they have blown his cover and then threatens to attack them. SpongeBob wants to know what to do next, then Patrick-Man says how he is going to use his superpowers. Patrick-Man then throws a barrel at the Dirty Bubble, but it just goes through him and accidentally hits Squidward. The Dirty Bubble laughs at him, and Patrick-Man then throws more items at him, still to no success. Running out of things to throw, Patrick-Man then throws SpongeBob at the Dirty Bubble, but he ends up eating him. Patrick-Man then uses his Pit Punch at the Dirty Bubble, but he ends up eating it and hitting SpongeBob.\nThe Dirty Bubble then decides to charge at Patrick-Man, but the latter spots a Krabby Patty on the ground and bends over with his ice cream cone hat, popping the Dirty Bubble and freeing SpongeBob. SpongeBob asks for Patrick-Man's autograph and he signs it. SpongeBob then asks what his next adventure is, but Patrick-Man takes off his ice cream cone hat and reverts to his old ways, essentially retiring because his job is too much work. Mr. Krabs then asks Patrick to use his \"powers\" one last time and hands him a broom and dustpan, making him clean the Krusty Krab, while Patrick asks about the two items he was given, and ending the episode."}
{"prompt": "Gary's New Toy", "completion": "As the episode begins, SpongeBob wakes up to his alarm clock acting strange. It eventually breaks apart and SpongeBob notices the clock has been chewed on. He assumes Gary is to blame. SpongeBob uses tape to fix it, though it just falls backwards. SpongeBob then jumps off his bed and into his slippers, but Gary has chewed on them as well. SpongeBob then goes to brush his teeth, but when he pulls out his toothbrush, Gary is on the other end, chewing on it. SpongeBob tries to pull it away from him, but receives no success. He then tickles Gary, which makes him finally let go of the toothbrush, but then he starts to chew on his toothpaste instead.\nSpongeBob wonders if Gary is teething again as milk goes through his bowl of cereal, and then Gary starts chewing on the table. SpongeBob then decides to buy Gary a chew toy. Gary licks him in response, then chews SpongeBob's nose.\nSpongeBob and Gary are at the Pet Store, looking to pick out which chew toy to get. They meet up with Patrick, who is having some \"free samples.\" SpongeBob tells Patrick why he is here and Patrick tells them that the chew toy is on an aisle next to the \"most delicious snail treats.\" They walk over to a stand that reads \"Tasty Time Snail Treats\" with the toy aisle right next to it. Patrick eats at the stand while SpongeBob and Gary browse for a new toy.\nSpongeBob picks out a bone, but Gary bites right through it. SpongeBob takes out a toy fire hydrant, but Gary bites onto the end, causing water to spray onto SpongeBob's face, thus disapproving SpongeBob into buying it. Patrick then points out the Pet Point 3000. SpongeBob is interested, but not so much Gary, who crawls away. Patrick then starts to play with the toy, but ends up getting the laser shot through his head and his brain pops out, which SpongeBob then puts back in. Gary then notices a shiny red ball and loves it, SpongeBob decides to buy it for him.\nBack at SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob and Gary are playing with Gary's new toy ball. SpongeBob asks for Gary to bring it back, but notices he is constantly chewing on it. SpongeBob walks off, happy that Gary is not chewing on any of his stuff anymore. SpongeBob notices that he has not heard Gary squeaking with the toy in awhile and starts to look for him. He then finds Gary having a tea party with his red ball. SpongeBob tries to join in, but Gary takes out a stroller, puts the red ball in it, and crawls away.\nSpongeBob, thinking Gary loves the red ball more than him, decides to lure him out with some Slimycan Snail Food. He goes into the garage and notices Gary wearing lipstick, which he finds creepy. SpongeBob tells Gary that he needs to spend some time away from the ball, but Gary hits the garage door button, causing SpongeBob to be lifted up and crushed on the ceiling.\nAnnoyed (and jealous because Gary likes the ball more than him), SpongeBob gets fed up with Gary's recent behavior and demands him to hand over the ball. SpongeBob hears from Gary that he has hidden it, but SpongeBob is suspicious, as Gary is crawling away. SpongeBob grabs Gary and opens up his shell to pull out three hairballs and his wallet. He reaches back into the shell and eventually finds the ball. SpongeBob then puts the ball on a high dresser and goes to sleep, telling Gary that he will be sick of the ball by the following morning. The red ball glows an ominous red, which causes Gary's eyes to turn red as well.\nThe next morning, SpongeBob wakes up and notices Gary and the red ball are gone. He starts to look for them and eventually finds Gary chewing on the ball on the ceiling. SpongeBob asks Gary to come down, but Gary does not budge. SpongeBob then walks on the ceiling to get him, but falls down. He then tries to use a broom, but ends up knocking his own eyes out of his head. SpongeBob eventually scrapes Gary down and tries to grab the ball, but Gary accidentally bites him instead. SpongeBob is shocked and tells Gary to make a choice: him or the ball. Gary leans towards the latter choice, leading SpongeBob to have to leave his pineapple house and find a new life.\nLater, Gary is watching television, but then gets hungry and so looks around the house for SpongeBob to feed him. He then remembers SpongeBob saying he is leaving and so then cries from his depression. Gary knows what is best and tries to go and find SpongeBob and apologize to him for his choice, but the ball stops him. It then starts bouncing everywhere, destroying everything in the process. Gary tries to get out of the house.\nHe makes it outside and SpongeBob is seen laying under a bus bench, still sad about Gary's choice. SpongeBob then notices Gary on the bus bench, happy that Gary changed his mind and finally decided to abandon the ball. \nOnce the two walk home, SpongeBob's house explodes and is set on fire while the firemen are trying to put the fire out. The red ball (that has became burnt due to the fire) flies out beside them and SpongeBob asks if it was his ball. Gary viciously hisses at it. The episode ends there."}
{"prompt": "License to Milkshake", "completion": "One day around lunchtime, while working at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob gets a last minute order to serve a milkshake, which he has not made in years. SpongeBob decides to make a simple milkshake in a blender and finishes it off by topping whipped cream and a cherry while walking out of the kitchen door. He serves it to Harold. Then, Harold says it tastes horrible and throws a temper tantrum, demanding a refund while angry. Mr. Krabs comes in and walks Harold out of the restaurant while telling him that SpongeBob will make a proper milkshake for him tomorrow. It is then revealed that SpongeBob's milkshake license expired seven years ago. Mr. Krabs then puts SpongeBob in a boatmobile and says he is taking him back to school.\nSpongeBob and Mr. Krabs later arrive at the Milkshake Academy and SpongeBob has to attend the academy to learn how to make a proper milkshake again. Captain Frostymug tells the cadets to man their milkshake stations. When SpongeBob mans his station, he realizes that there are more buttons and contraptions than he is used to, but thinks he still can make a milkshake with no problem. Later, when he tries to mix the milkshake, he repeatedly pushes the wrong button. Frostymug comes over and has to inform SpongeBob that the controls are different and he has to push the button on the lower control panel. When SpongeBob manages to finally mix his milkshake, he lets Frostymug try it. However, when he tries it, the milkshake is frozen and it ends up in his eye. Frostymug suggests they need to get back to the basics. He tells SpongeBob that before he makes a milkshake, he needs to know what it feels like to be a milkshake. He makes him go into the Shake Simulator, which shapes cadets who enter it into a milkshake-shaped blob. Frostymug sets the Simulator on \"Obliterate,\" which makes the students gasp. A cadet reminds him that no one has ever survived Obliterate, to which he responds that he needs to learn. The simulator shakes, rattles, and rolls SpongeBob. Captain Frostymug decides to see how SpongeBob turned out and gets angry when he sees that he survived, was unaffected, and actually found it fun, believing it to be a fun carnival ride and asking to go again.\nAngry, Frostymug says that he has never had such an \"unteachable moron\" in 30 years. He asks his students to tell him how he could teach SpongeBob how to make a milkshake. SpongeBob replies that he will show the students that he can make a milkshake properly.\nHowever, during the courses of making a milkshake, SpongeBob fails doing them all. During graduation, SpongeBob expects to get his milkshake license at this event. However, Captain Frostymug gives everyone milkshake licenses except for SpongeBob, since he could not even get past Step #1 of making a milkshake, which was filling the glass with ice cream. SpongeBob tells Frostymug that he will keep trying and heads to the milkshake machine. Captain Frostymug tells him he needs to put the milkshake up to \"the spinny thing.\" Then, he stops, flashing back to 20 years ago.\nIn the flashback, he was the owner of a milkshake café called Milk Shake. Many customers were excited to have Frostymug's milkshakes. However, when he tried to make a milkshake for an eager customer, he ended up splattering the milkshake all over the store. A bit of milkshake got on the cords that connect to the milkshake machine, destroying it. The milkshake machine squirted out milkshake stains onto the customers, frightening them and ruining Frostymug's career. He informs SpongeBob that he has not touched the milkshake machine in 20 years and gets his hand stuck in the machine. He is about to get his arm and all of him sucked into the machine, but SpongeBob is able to grab and save him. The machine ends up exploding, but Frostymug thanks SpongeBob for saving him. Thanks to the machine incident, Frostymug's arm is hurt. He realizes that he does not need a machine to make a milkshake and tells SpongeBob that a milkshake comes from within the heart.\nThe next day, at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob serves Harold a milkshake, which he replies is the best he has ever had. Everyone now wants to buy SpongeBob's milkshakes. Captain Frostymug comes in, requesting a milkshake and gives SpongeBob his new milkshake license to which SpongeBob replies, \"If only it were this easy to get a boating license\" and ends the episode laughing."}
{"prompt": "Squid Baby", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, Squidward is relaxing in his bathtub, when SpongeBob and Patrick, who are playing with SpongeBob's old baby toys, disturb Squidward, who comes out and demands them to stop making noises and act mature. However, SpongeBob and Patrick do not listen. Squidward walks back to his house, but he slips on a toy along the way and hits his head. His injuries to the head cause him to act like an infant himself. SpongeBob and Patrick then bring him to the hospital.\nAt the hospital, a doctor tells them that Squidward has developed a mental disorder called \"Head-Go-Boom-Boom-Itis\" due to his head trauma. It means he is mentally and socially an infant despite being an adult. The doctor also says that his head must be protected from more injury, or else he will likely remain infantile.\nHowever, later at SpongeBob's pineapple, when SpongeBob decides to feed Squidward, Patrick hurts Squidward's head by tossing him up into the ceiling. SpongeBob reminds him that they are supposed to protect Squidward's head, not hurt it more. SpongeBob tries to feed Squidward, but he does not like his food and spits it all over SpongeBob. Patrick licks the food off SpongeBob's face and thanks Squidward for sharing. Then, they try to entertain Squidward with some games. They start off with \"Kelpy Cake,\" but when Squidward does it, he ends up slapping SpongeBob and Patrick repeatedly, sending them flying into the air and out of the house into the street.\nSquidward escapes, and SpongeBob and Patrick follow him as he crawls out to the street, where a truck is about to hit Squidward. The truck driver is asleep, but Patrick is able to protect Squidward and lift up the road to send the truck flying. However, when Patrick drops the road back into place, he accidentally smashes Squidward's head again. Then, SpongeBob and Patrick go back inside and put Squidward in a cage, but Squidward does not like the cage and begins to cry.\nHe cries for several days. Then, three days later, SpongeBob goes to work with Patrick and asks him if he can watch Squidward while he works, but Patrick, tired from taking care of Squidward, falls asleep on a table.\nSpongeBob informs an angry Mr. Krabs that Squidward has the mind of an infant and cannot work. Mr. Krabs does not care, since there are customers outside the door, literally begging to give Mr. Krabs their money. SpongeBob then gets an idea. He brings Squidward to the cash register and puts him in a high chair. When Squidward drops his head on the cash register, SpongeBob duct-tapes him to the seat so he cannot escape. When Mr. Krabs lets the customers in, Squidward sucks on a customer's hand and head and SpongeBob stops him.\nSpongeBob then gives Squidward the order papers to write orders on, but Squidward instead doodles on them and throws them into the kitchen. SpongeBob asks him if it will be for there or to \"goo.\" SpongeBob peeks out the order window and sees Squidward doodling on Nat Peterson's face. Nat screams and ends up running out of the restaurant. Pilar scolds Squidward for not taking an order. Squidward types in something, then he bangs his jaw on the cash register and wails loudly.\nSpongeBob thinks Squidward is crying because Pilar yelled at him and SpongeBob tells Pilar he should be ashamed. Squidward then dirties his diaper. The customers smell the horrible stench of Squidward's diaper and Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to change it. Everywhere he goes to change Squidward's diaper, people are sitting or getting condiments or walking. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to take Squidward to the kitchen, where the food is prepared, and change it. This disgusts the customers, so they leave.\nMr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to get Squidward out of his restaurant. SpongeBob cries and tells Mr. Krabs that if Squidward is not welcome there, he is not staying either. However, on the way out, he ends up slipping on Squidward's baby rattle and slips into the kitchen, where he bangs Squidward's head on the frying pans and the fryer.\nSquidward falls into the ice machine and ice pours out onto Squidward's head, curing his head trauma and returning him to his adult state. SpongeBob is relieved that Squidward is \"grown-up again\" and a confused Squidward asks why he would not be grown up. He notices that he is wearing a diaper and that it is full.\nWhen SpongeBob is about to tell Squidward that he was going to change him, a deadpanned Squidward tells SpongeBob to not say another word about that experience, ever, and then leaves the scene. SpongeBob then replies, \"Kids, they grow up so fast,\" as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Little Yellow Book", "completion": "At the Krusty Krab one day, business is slow. As a result, Squidward decides to rest. Before he even gets a chance to do so, a lot of customers come in and start surrounding him. Squidward freaks out when he realizes SpongeBob is not cooking. Squidward then finds SpongeBob in a barrel, encouraging him to get back to work. SpongeBob starts making food and serves everybody while Squidward finds a book in the barrel. Then, SpongeBob snatches it away from him and puts it in between the two frying baskets.\nA few minutes later, SpongeBob takes a break and Squidward finds the book in the barrel again. Now that he finds out the book was a diary, Squidward reads it to everyone at the Krusty Krab, revealing sensitive information about SpongeBob.\nLater, SpongeBob finds out Squidward has been reading his diary and becomes sad and humiliated. As a result, he runs out of the Krusty Krab crying.\nEveryone now realizes that this was SpongeBob's diary, so they get angry and disgusted by Squidward's actions, and leave the restaurant in anger. Mr. Krabs angrily scolds Squidward for his actions and demands that he apologize, but Squidward is too callous to feel remorse over his harassment toward SpongeBob. Squidward is soon hated by all of Bikini Bottom. Later on, he finds a newspaper that publicizes his recent behavior, but is unaffected by the notoriety. Then he goes to a taxi, but the taxi driver just drives away because of what Squidward did to SpongeBob. As Squidward walks away, he has been ridiculed and insulted by Bikini Bottom citizens for reading SpongeBob's diary. Much later, he goes to his house, only to find out that his loan was taken away due to reading SpongeBob's diary. It appears that Squidward has got what he deserves for his harassment towards SpongeBob.\nWith his house privileges now revoked and sees that his luck has finally run out, Squidward sleeps on a bench. However, two police officers arrive and tell him that he cannot sleep in the bench, until they recognize him and lock him in the stocks. Patrick arrives and throws tomatoes at him. Patrick furiously berates Squidward for reading his best friend's diary and leaves in anger, before throwing another tomato away at Squidward in revenge. Then SpongeBob comes and Squidward subsequently apologizes to SpongeBob and he learns that because everyone was amused by it, it got published and became a best seller. SpongeBob also tells him that he only read his work diary, and not his secret personal diary, which - in his opinion- would have been more embarrassing.\nThis inspires Squidward to read SpongeBob's diary once again, and, because of this, SpongeBob cries in humiliation and runs away. The episode ends with tomatoes being thrown at Squidward by the disgusted, hypocritical and angry crowd, with Squidward laughing as he reads SpongeBob's diary and not caring about his comeuppance, deeming that it was to be worth it."}

Mrs. Puff gets very angry at SpongeBob after he fails the test again. SpongeBob cries and run to his house. At home, Mrs. Puff thinks about how SpongeBob could pass his driving test, and then realizes SpongeBob is afraid of the course and that if she took him to drive on a real road, he would pass and he would eventually be out of her life forever. Mrs. Puff goes over to SpongeBob's house and tells him to forget about what she said earlier. Mrs. Puff takes SpongeBob to an abandoned road, but SpongeBob is scared.\nMrs. Puff tells him to keep repeating \"Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road\" to get his confidence back. SpongeBob follows her instructions and imagines himself doing crazy driving tricks and poses as he proceeds to repeat the phrase. When SpongeBob has almost passed all the tests, Mrs. Puff tells him to safely dock the vessel as the last step, but due to constantly repeating the phrase, SpongeBob has mesmerized himself into a daze and cannot focus on what he is doing. He soon drives out of the road and freaks out. SpongeBob gets on a dangerous shortcut and gets back on a road, but he actually gets on a 10-lane intertidal seaway and he is gripped with fear and cannot concentrate.\nA police officer sees them speeding and thought they were reckless drivers because Mrs. Puff crossed the county line, which she should not have done. The police officer tells SpongeBob to pull over, but instead he accelerates. Then, when Mrs. Puff tells to stop the vessel again, he finally parks the boat safely. Mrs. Puff gives SpongeBob his driver's license and screams: \"I'm free!.\" But the police officer does not think so. He arrests Mrs. Puff for violating the parole and rips up SpongeBob's license.

{"prompt": "Eek, an Urchin!", "completion": "The episode opens with SpongeBob cooking a Krabby Patty. When he pours ketchup on it, he accidentally gets some on the floor. He then proceeds to clean it up with a spray bottle and a cloth, but he ends up spraying himself in the face and drops the can of spray under the grill. SpongeBob goes to grab at the spray the first time, but pulls out a skull. He throws it away and then he tries again, only to pull out a sea urchin. The urchin crawls around SpongeBob, and he tries to get Squidward to help him. Squidward eventually comes to the kitchen to see what is going on, only to find that the urchin is on his foot. Both SpongeBob and Squidward call Mr. Krabs for help, and Mr. Krabs enters the kitchen. He does not believe them at first, until he finds the urchin on his claw, and he jumps onto the grill along with SpongeBob and Squidward. Unfortunately for them, the grill is still on, and all of their feet get burned. SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs each jump into a bathroom stall to cool off their feet. The three try new ways to get the urchin out of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob tries to catch it in a bucket, but ends up getting smashed into the wall and ends up in the bucket himself. Mr. Krabs tries to hurt the urchin by smashing a broom on it, but Mr. Krabs gets beaten up in the process. SpongeBob then tells Squidward to stop the urchin before it gets into the dining room, but he only steps aside, allowing the urchin to pass by. The urchin causes trouble in the dining room by being on a Krabby Patty, being swallowed then coughed back out by a fish, and even has a lady eat off one of its quills. The urchin then goes back into the kitchen, much to SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward's reliefs. However, when SpongeBob mentions the urchin, the customers suddenly start running all over the place causing chaos.\nPlankton, meanwhile, is heading up to the Krusty Krab with another plan at stealing the secret formula by using glasses as a disguise. However, he ends up being trampled by the customers and heads inside to see what is going on. Mr. Krabs is not happy to see him, as he states that they have enough pests already. Plankton is confused, until he looks over to see the urchin. Plankton jumps onto SpongeBob's face, saying how he hates those things. He concludes that he cannot steal the secret formula with the urchin running around and promises that he will not steal the formula until after the urchin is caught. Mr. Krabs reluctantly agrees to the temporary truce, claiming it will take a pest to catch a pest. Plankton then calls Karen on his cell phone, telling her to send over his Death Robot. Then, after he calls Karen, the robot appears in the Krusty Krab, with Plankton saying that this is their champion. Mr. Krabs is angry, but Plankton says it is not in action mode yet. Plankton sets the robot to take out the urchin where it begins chasing it down. However, the robot viciously begins destroying everything in its path while trying to smash the urchin. The urchin eventually hides in Mr. Krabs' cash register, and when the Death Robot tries to attack the register, Mr. Krabs gets in the way. The robot accidentally rips off Mr. Krabs' shell and arms, then puts him back together. Mr. Krabs asks for the mallet from the robot, then starts to smash it over and over again, eventually turning it into a lunchbox. Mr. Krabs then calls for SpongeBob to open the register while he catches the urchin in the lunchbox. When SpongeBob opens the cash register, the urchin is seen eating Mr. Krabs' money. Mr. Krabs, furious, then begins to smash apart his cash register, hoping he got the urchin. However, the urchin is on his mallet, freaking out Mr. Krabs. Squidward then appears grateful because his prickly plant is safe. When Plankton walks beside the plant, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs have an idea, much to Plankton's worry.\nMr. Krabs and SpongeBob then start to create a cactus costume for Plankton, trying to make him look like the urchin. They also paint the costume blue and puts a pink bow on top, thus making Plankton look like a female sea urchin (even calling him Planktonella). Mr. Krabs then throws Plankton into the kitchen, hoping that he will try to lure the urchin out by charming it. Plankton walks around slowly until he finds the urchin. He works his charms, with the urchin actually falling in love with him. Things get too tense for Plankton after the urchin touches him, and Plankton ends up under the kitchen grill. Plankton then finds 100 more sea urchins that then proceed to chase after him. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob then block off the hole with the cash register boat and board up the back door, preventing the urchins and Plankton from escaping. Plankton is soon taken by the urchins, asking for help. Squidward then wants to put an end to all of this and uses the thermostat to turn down the temperature in the kitchen, causing Plankton and the urchins to slow down. He turns it all the way down, causing them to freeze in place. SpongeBob is then ready with a trash can, with Mr. Krabs turning back up the heat, causing the urchins to defrost and fall into the trash can. Mr. Krabs then tells SpongeBob to take the urchins farther and farther away many times. SpongeBob then stops and releases the urchins into the Krusty Krab unknowingly. SpongeBob then walks off whistling, as the episode closes."}

Squidward asks what he is doing, and SpongeBob tells him that he is planning to do karate with Sandy, which Squidward thinks is stupid. That night, Squidward is grocery shopping and is approached by a large thug (The Creepy Creeper). Squidward assumes he is going to steal his groceries, so he runs to SpongeBob and asks to be taught karate. However, because SpongeBob is not very good at it himself, he is unable to teach Squidward.\nThey then go to Sandy for help. First, she makes Squidward promise not to use it for revenge and use it only for protection. Then, she and SpongeBob try to teach him, but cannot. When Squidward says that he had vengeance during training, Sandy then decides to quit on him, but Squidward says he would do anything, so Sandy makes him do all the work around the treedome, saying that it will teach him the basic movements. Finally, Squidward decides to quit. However, he accidentally flings acorns at himself that he is able to dodge. He then finds out that in doing all the work, he actually did learn karate.\nSo then, Sandy presents him his belt to show that he knows karate, but Squidward claims that he has \"important business\" to attend. He then finds the thug and uses karate to beat him up, with a lot of the moves being related to the housework he did around the treedome.\nHowever, it turns out that he never wanted to steal his groceries; he wanted to return them. SpongeBob and Sandy then come to give Squidward his belt only to find out that he used karate for vengeance. Sandy says that Squidward does not deserve his belt, and SpongeBob scolds Squidward for not taking Sandy's advice. Then they walk away because Squidward dishonored their trust in him.

{"prompt": "Jailbreak!", "completion": "The episode begins with the narrator explaining the Bikini Bottom Jail, mainly its newest member, Plankton. The warden lets all of the prisoners out, including Plankton. Plankton hears SpongeBob calling out to him, who wants to know why he is present. SpongeBob exclaims that he was hired by Mr. Krabs to watch over him at the jail every weekend as another job in the Krusty Krab. Plankton does not like the idea, but the prison warden tells him to quiet down.\nThe scene changes over to a room, where Karen is about to send over a cake to SpongeBob, which is for Plankton. Plankton asks if Karen had put the file in the cake, but Karen just laughs, thinking he is joking. Plankton unsuccessfully tries to jump over the glass, but SpongeBob grabs him.\nIn the cafeteria, Plankton attempts to eat his food, but a purple cellmate grabs some of his beans and eats them. Another green cellmate drinks Plankton's milk, and then Plankton gets eaten by a light blue cellmate. Plankton yells out that he is the evilest genius and yells out his name. The purple cellmate, thinking the light blue cellmate is talking, does not believe him, saying he and the others are fans of Plankton. Plankton calls out his name again and then the purple cellmate punches the light blue cellmate in the stomach, which causes Plankton to be punched out and crash into the wall. The purple and green cellmates start to beat up the light blue cellmate until Plankton breaks it up. Plankton introduces himself to the cellmates and they say how they are going to do everything that Plankton says. Plankton gets excited, saying how easily he could get the Krabby Patty secret formula.\nOutside, Plankton is explaining to his cellmates how to escape from the Bikini Bottom Jail. The cellmates have ideas, but Plankton tells them they need better ones. The whale cellmate says they could break out only if they had chum and the other cellmates agree, explaining how they used it in crimes before they got busted. Plankton is surprised by the cellmates saying how chum is great for committing crimes. Plankton asks if chum is great for eating, but the cellmates do not think so. Realizing he overlooked the capabilities of chum, Plankton then agrees to make chum for the cellmates, and they all cheer. Inside Plankton's jail cell, Plankton, and his cellmates are creating chum using different kinds of items. SpongeBob overhears them and runs to the Krusty Krab to warn Mr. Krabs. At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that Plankton is planning to break into the Krusty Krab with his cellmates. Mr. Krabs insures SpongeBob that he will handle the problem.\nBack at Bikini Bottom Jail, a Prison Warden is talking to two of Plankton's cellmates, saying why they are out of their cells. The purple cellmate says that the green cellmate said the napkin smells like kelp berries. The prison warden smells the napkin and falls down, unconscious. The Purple and Green cellmates bring the Prison Warden inside, while Plankton arms himself with chum and a bomb. The Whale cellmate then launches Plankton to the other side of the prison, and Plankton plants the bomb on the wall. Plankton gets spotted, but the bomb goes off and blows a giant hole in the wall. However, the Prison Wardens then start filling up the wall, making it impossible for Plankton to get through. However, they get stuck and Plankton uses the opportunity to lead all of his cellmates out through the front door. At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob notices Plankton and all of his cellmates preparing to invade the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs says that they are ready for them, while Plankton yells out to his cellmates to bring him the formula. Plankton's cellmates begin breaking down the door using the whale cellmate as a battering ram, and they successfully break-in. The Whale Prisoner then opens the safe, with Mr. Krabs urging Plankton not to get it, but Plankton does not listen. As Plankton heads toward the \"formula,\" the curtain rises and the entire Bikini Bottom Police Force emerges from it. Mr. Krabs reveals that he knew of Plankton's attempted break-in and had enough time to hide the entire Police Force in his safe. The Police Force then takes Plankton and the rest of his cellmates back to jail. SpongeBob congratulates Mr. Krabs on how he always wins, but then the entire Krusty Krab falls apart.

Unfortunately, SpongeBob uses too much of an explosive ingredient, which causes their faces to be blown off. SpongeBob notices a fax coming, but Mr. Krabs says that they will get it later. It is none other than Plankton, who had faxed himself into the Krusty Krab, saying the first phase of his plan is complete. Plankton then starts \"Phase 2\" by sawing a bit of SpongeBob's spatula, then places it beside the grill. SpongeBob then comes along and tries to flip a Krabby Patty, but his spatula breaks in half. He tries everything to fix it, but Mr. Krabs just tells SpongeBob to get a new spatula, and he leaves.\nThe scene changes to Harvey's Spatula Emporium, where Plankton awaits for SpongeBob's arrival. He then begins \"Phase 3\" by flying out of the store with his jetpack and flies into SpongeBob. SpongeBob wants to know what is Plankton doing at the Emporium, and Plankton responds to holding an object, saying SpongeBob does not know what it is. SpongeBob successfully identifies the part as a handle cap for a vintage spatula, and Plankton is amazed. Plankton then offers SpongeBob his own special spatula with \"magical powers,\" which SpongeBob quickly agrees. They arrive at the Chum Bucket, where Plankton shows off a room full of spatulas and introduces SpongeBob to the Majestic Sizzlemaster. SpongeBob is excited, and takes his new spatula out of the Chum Bucket. Plankton starts \"Phase 4,\" with Karen questioning on how many phases he has in his plan. Plankton then heads into the control room, with Karen saying that it is enough to gain SpongeBob's trust and steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. Plankton then turns on the spatula and the scene changes to SpongeBob showing off the Majestic Sizzlemaster to Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs just tells SpongeBob to get back to work, and SpongeBob heads into the kitchen with the Sizzlemaster. SpongeBob is about to handle all of the orders coming in and the Sizzlemaster soon starts talking, not knowing it is Plankton talking through the other end. SpongeBob is confused, trying not to believe the Sizzlemaster is talking, but Squidward shouts out to him, saying the customers are getting upset. SpongeBob starts to flip the Krabby Patties, but the Sizzlemaster tells SpongeBob that there is a faster way of doing that and it extends its head, flipping four Patties at the same time. SpongeBob is amazed, but still says that they are a long way from completing all of the orders and starts alternating between putting condiments on the buns and flipping the Krabby Patties. The Sizzlemaster (Plankton) tells SpongeBob that it will flip the patties while he handles the condiments. SpongeBob agrees, but says that he will handle the grill, saying he does not trust anybody with it.\nMeanwhile, Squidward is dealing with Nat Peterson, who is angry and impatient, while SpongeBob hands the Krabby Patties through the window. Squidward hands out the Krabby Patties to the customers while SpongeBob is talking with the Sizzlemaster about the empty grill. The Sizzlemaster then \"flies\" to the freezer and takes out more Krabby Patties and puts them all on the grill. During closing time, Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob he is leaving and thanks him for all the work. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs to thank the \"new magic talking spatula,\" but Mr. Krabs gets angry at SpongeBob for talking to a \"talking spatula,\" but tells him to only do it if it makes him money. Mr. Krabs leaves and SpongeBob thanks the Sizzlemaster for the help. The Sizzlemaster hopes to work the grill, but SpongeBob still disagrees about it, and he leaves the Sizzlemaster on a hook and leaves. Plankton talks to himself, saying he still needs to gain SpongeBob's trust to work the grill, and he calls back out to SpongeBob through the Sizzlemaster. The Sizzlemaster hopes to go home with SpongeBob and help around the house, but SpongeBob says he is not grilling. The Sizzlemaster then says he is a multi-purpose tool and SpongeBob finally agrees. They arrive at SpongeBob's house, and the Sizzlemaster (with Plankton talking of course) then decides to start \"Phase 5.\" SpongeBob then tosses the Sizzlemaster into Gary's litter box, which the Sizzlemaster has to clean, and SpongeBob walks off. Plankton barks at Karen for adding \"smell sensors\" to the Sizzlemaster.\nThe next morning, SpongeBob gets ready to go to work, with the Sizzlemaster helping out in every way of his daily routines. They arrive at the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob thanks the Sizzlemaster. The Sizzlemaster then pulls up a chair for SpongeBob and says he will do all the work for him. SpongeBob agrees and he sits in the chair. The Sizzlemaster finally gets to work at the grill. Plankton then finally ends \"Phase 5\" and starts up \"Phase 6,\" which involves the Sizzlemaster burning up all of the Krabby Patties on the grill.\nSpongeBob is upset, but the Sizzlemaster suggests getting the secret formula to make more Krabby Patties. SpongeBob agrees and walks into Mr. Krabs' office and starts unlocking the safe. Mr. Krabs asks SpongeBob what he is doing, and SpongeBob says that the Sizzlemaster he got from Plankton needs to know the secret formula, making Mr. Krabs suspicious. Realizing that it is another one of Plankton's schemes, Mr. Krabs then starts telling the ingredients for a fake formula and Plankton starts adding them in. After pouring an entire bottle of Disulfide (explosive bottle), Plankton does not know that it is approved for restaurant use until he hears Mr. Krabs saying that it is not. Plankton looks at the label too late, then the entire Chum Bucket is blown up, and Plankton and Karen land in front of Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.

{"prompt": "It Came from Goo Lagoon", "completion": "It is a typical day at Goo Lagoon, and SpongeBob and Patrick are having fun playing on the beach. Suddenly, large purple goo bubbles arise out of a volcanic crack at the bottom of the lagoon. Two of these bubbles approach SpongeBob and Patrick while they are about to drown at sea. They bounce the goo bubbles like a ball on seawater, accidentally hitting some fish swimming with a floater, a surfer, and a cheerleading-style posed fish. Meanwhile, Plankton tries to sell his chum from a wheelbarrow when Squidward smashes him with an umbrella. SpongeBob and Patrick use their Mucus Bubbles to likewise bounce and smash Squidward and his belongings. Plankton thinks that it is Karma and he notices that SpongeBob and Patrick are bouncing the goo bubble like a ball. He does not know what it is and tries to ask Squidward, but Squidward leaves him and angrily scolds SpongeBob and Patrick. \nSoon, Sandy approaches them. Sandy tries to explain to SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, the Bikini Bottomites, and Plankton that the bubbles are made of a highly toxic \"Super Goo.\" She explains that they are safe when stable, but as is, they are very unstable, and if popped, they can coat a large portion of Bikini Bottom in purple goo. Plankton hears this and unveils a multi purpose ship, which he uses to find the crevasse and produce a bubble large enough to cover the entire city, as most are rather small (about the size of beach balls). Then he goes under the lagoon in a ship to find the crack where the bubbles are coming from.\nMeanwhile, more bubbles begin to arise from the lagoon, and the Bikini Bottomites begin to use the bubbles. Although Sandy said that they were dangerous, SpongeBob and Patrick continue to use the goo bubbles as bouncy balls. Squidward begins to use the goo as a hairdo. The other citizens continue to use it for their own purposes as well. Perch Perkins begins to report for the Bikini Bottom News with Johnny. He states how the Goo Bubbles are popular at Goo Lagoon. While on the air, Sandy, now going partly insane with her theory, once again tries to warn them to stop playing with the goo. Again, nobody believes her. Plankton continues on his quest to put the goo to use, determined to find the crack at any cost. Soon, he does find it. Plankton, as well as Karen, widen the crack and unleash the largest Goo Bubble yet. It rises out of Goo Lagoon, finally convincing everyone to evacuate the beach.\nThe trio examines the bubble and realizes it is dangerous. They need to stop it with supplies from Sandy's treedome, so SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy proceed to her treedome. However, Patrick gets swept into the bubble. The duo gets into Sandy's submarine at her treedome, then proceeds to save Patrick. They soon find the giant bubble and they tell Patrick to get in the Submarine, but Patrick refuses, so they send down a crane to grab Patrick, who is sitting on the goo. Patrick is pulled into the submarine, and then the three prepare themselves to stop the bubble. They soon discover that Plankton is controlling the bubble after they see his ship. The recently reunited trio pursuit Plankton around the bubble. They catch him rather easily. Sadly, it is revealed to be a trap; Plankton outsmarts the trio and sends them off the bubble. To rub salt into the wound, Plankton also destroys Sandy's submarine. The trio then pursues Plankton on foot through downtown Bikini Bottom.\nThey end up at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, many Bikini Bottomites, and Mr. Krabs confront Plankton and the bubble in front of the Krusty Krab and Chum Bucket. SpongeBob attempts to send the bubble away via creating a massive \"Bubble Bruiser.\" The attempt, however, backfires. Plankton once again demands that Mr. Krabs hands him the Krabby Patty formula or else he will pop the bubble, and leave the entire city covered in purple goo. Left with an ultimatum of giving up the formula or either having an angry mob destroy the Krusty Krab and do it themselves, or having to spend an extended period of time cleaning Bikini Bottom, Mr. Krabs reluctantly surrenders and gives him the \"formula.\" However, Plankton, in the ultimate act of welching, pops the bubble anyway, causing the entire city to get covered in purple goo.\nPlankton gets away and proceeds to read the \"formula \" on his ship. It reads, \"Just one Ingredient...\". He quickly realizes the formula is fake when he pulls down the paper, revealing a stick of Dynamite. The Dynamite stick explodes, causing his ship to crash into the roof of the Chum Bucket. Mr. Krabs, covered in goo, laughs at Plankton's comeuppance. Sandy reminds him that everyone and everything in Bikini Bottom is still covered in goo. However, Mr. Krabs tells her that even in a worst-case scenario, he can still make a profit. He creates a cleaning vendor, where they are cleaned by a second \"Bubble Bruiser\" created by SpongeBob, as the episode ends."}

Mr. Krabs disguises as a mustachioed man, but the disguise fails.\nMr. Krabs disguises again, but as a woman, and Nancy tells him he has to make a deposit. Having no understandings of banking, Mr. Krabs chooses to deposit only a penny instead of large amount of money to gain huge interests, but is anguished.

He goes to Pearl, then he calls Mr. Krabs, who says he is running out of oxygen. He then goes to Patrick and asks for his help to break in a bank. Patrick does a spit-take and is shocked at how crazy this is, only to say it is great.\nSpongeBob and Patrick arrive at the bank and discuss how to retrieve Krabs. Patrick brings some shoelaces, and SpongeBob grapples them to the roof. The shoelaces untie themselves, and he falls. Patrick brings a grappling hook, but it also fails after they took the vent that led that back at the front. He has a key, and SpongeBob commands him to use finesse.

One turns on the lights and the other opened the pens. The guard worm, sea monkey, and sea urchin all chase SpongeBob and Plankton. When they lose the animals, Plankton realizes Spot had been on his optical cornea (his eye) the whole time. The other pets then find Plankton and SpongeBob again, so Spot tries to scare them off.

When he finishes making the patty, Mr. Krabs comes up and tells him he is fired. SpongeBob is devastated by the news, as Mr. Krabs says the reason why he is firing him is because he found out he can save a nickel if he cuts off SpongeBob's salary completely. Squidward then asks if he can be fired as well, but Mr. Krabs states he cannot be fired as he has seniority, to his dismay. SpongeBob offers to work for free, but Mr. Krabs states he already thought of that, though he had found out he cannot because it is illegal and he would lose his vendor's license. As a result, SpongeBob starts crying uncontrollably and floods the Krusty Krab with his tears. Not sympathetic to this, Squidward drains his tears and escorts the sad sponge out and mockingly tells him he should come back \"as a customer,\" which makes him cry again before Squidward closes the blinds on a sulking SpongeBob. Then, he congratulates Mr. Krabs for his decision and asks him who is going to make the patties. Mr. Krabs tells him that he was a \"golden spatula fry cook\" in the navy, so he is going to be the new chef before the spatula spontaneously bursts into flames as Squidward comments on the impending disaster.\nSpongeBob then goes home, still sad about his situation from The Krusty Krab, as he is comforted by Gary, who also wants to be fed. SpongeBob feeds him, but continues to cry as he hears Patrick cry because he is doing so too. Feeling bad, SpongeBob invites him to come inside, before (at first unsuccessfully) telling him about his situation. However, Patrick tells him that being unemployed is the best gig that he knows and tells SpongeBob he is going to come back the next day to tell him the steps of glorious unemployment.\nThe next day, Patrick arrives to get SpongeBob. A disheveled and unshaven SpongeBob opens the door. SpongeBob appears to have gotten depressed from being fired. Patrick is determined to show SpongeBob the bright side of unemployment. He tells him the 3 steps of glorious unemployment, or as Patrick likes to call it, \"fun-employment.\" The steps are breakfast with Squidward, taking a mid-morning siesta, and free lunch with friends. First, they go to Squidward's house and step on his plants. Angered, Squidward throws food at them to go away as Patrick compliments on SpongeBob's \"fun-employment\" spirit. Next, Patrick and SpongeBob stick themselves to Patrick's rock to sleep, but SpongeBob falls down, ending act 1.\nAct 2 begins with the pair walking to Sandy's treedome, where she is handing out food, which is really toxic waste that gives off mutations, such as a puffy face for one fish and an extra forehead for Patrick.\nSandy then notices SpongeBob, who tells her he lost his job and tries to eat the food that she made, but she quickly prevents him from eating the slop, as he asks about it and she explains her real goal is doing a psychological test to determine how much stuff (as she does not even know what this \"stuff\" is) they eat, for free. Sandy then tells SpongeBob that he needs to get a new job and not be like the \"freeloaders.\" Motivated by her words, SpongeBob tells Patrick that \"fun-employment\" may be fun for him, but he needs to get a new job. When Patrick's second head insults him, Patrick angrily hits the latter for insulting his friend and tells SpongeBob to go ahead with his decision. With that, he turns from a depressed sponge back into a happy and joyful sponge again, and he goes looking for a job.\nThe first job SpongeBob arrives at is the Weenie Hut, where he gets employed by Mister Weiner. However, Mister Weiner soon fires SpongeBob due to him making Weenie Patties instead of hot dogs. Next, SpongeBob goes to Pizza Piehole, where he gets hired by Pizza Pete to make pizzas, but SpongeBob makes a Pizza Patty, much to Pizza Pete's disapproval, resulting in SpongeBob getting fired again. Next, SpongeBob goes to Taco Sombrero; he gets hired and makes a Burrito Patty, and Señor Taco decides to give it a try and asks a customer to taste it. Pilar volunteers, but when he takes a bite, the burrito meat gets into Billy and Frank's faces, so he gets fired once again. SpongeBob then cries an excuse to Señor Taco, but the latter just strictly fires him. Next and shortly, a crying SpongeBob goes to Wet Noodle, but he gets fired yet again, and Noodleman throws the Noodle Patty on SpongeBob, causing him to say he will take his cooking home.\nSpongeBob becomes depressed about being fired several times in one day as he goes home. When he arrives home, Gary asks him for snail food, but he says he does not have any, so he makes a homemade can of snail food for Gary. SpongeBob tastes a bit of it, saying it tastes great. Gary eats the food, saying it is the best food he ever tasted. Patrick and his second head also eat the food.\nThen, there is a knock on the door, which SpongeBob answers. The Hotdog Minions trap SpongeBob in a hot dog bun and take him away. It turns out Mr. Weiner has kidnapped him and \"promotes\" him because of his idea of Weenie Patties while ignoring his mentioning of firing him. SpongeBob cannot leave because he got chained, until Pete comes along and frees him with pizza sauce, only for him to kidnap him with breadstick cuffs. Soon, it is a war against all the owners of each restaurant, who now see how useful SpongeBob's creations were. This results in a tug of war until the Killer Krabby Patty defeats them and takes him back to the Krusty Krab, where angry customers are leaving because of Mr. Krabs' terrible cooking. Mr. Krabs thanks Killer Krabby Patty, who is then revealed to be Squidward in disguise, for bringing SpongeBob back. Squidward admits that even though he hates SpongeBob, he hates the smell of burnt Krabby Patties even more. He begs SpongeBob to come back and become a fry cook again.\nSpongeBob says he would if it was okay with Mr. Krabs, who apologizes to SpongeBob for firing him in the first place since the Krusty Krab is falling apart without him, and rehires SpongeBob. Ecstatic at being rehired, SpongeBob cleans the whole restaurant and gives Mr. Krabs and Squidward a new suit and dress.\nAs the episode closes, SpongeBob later serves the customers patties again, even inviting his old bosses over for a meal to make amends.

However, SpongeBob wants to be there even earlier and thinks they should take a shortcut. Squidward tries to explain why there is no shortcut and why they should not try to find one, but SpongeBob still thinks he should as he states his belief that there is always a shortcut.\nSquidward then asks SpongeBob on what moron told him that nonsense, as Patrick conveniently walks by them and says that there is always a shortcut, making Squidward understand it was him.\nSpongeBob says that he is going to find the shortcut, as Squidward shows that the restaurant is up ahead with Mr. Krabs standing outside. SpongeBob asks Squidward if he wants to join, but the latter declines, so SpongeBob takes a different path, thinking he can find a shorter way to get there, but bumps into Squidward walking in the normal path, who repeats his words, though he sees that SpongeBob still does not get it.\nHe then tries to take another shortcut and finds himself in an unusual part of the town. SpongeBob tries to think it is a great shortcut and tells himself not to forget his wilderness training. He tries to remember what Sandy said, and then proceeds to find the Krusty Krab.\nHe tries to do what he learned from wilderness training, starts with local landmarks, and assigns a broken fire hydrant as his landmark. He then spots a sign that appears to be the Krusty Krab sign, so he climbs over a fence and runs to it.\nThe scene pans to the Krusty Krab with Squidward relaxing in his workstation, and then Mr. Krabs appears telling Squidward to stop lazing around, even though there are no customers.\nThe scene cuts back to SpongeBob going toward what he thinks is the Krusty Krab, but it turns out to just be a sign that says \"The Krabby Krust.\" He notices a fish painting signs and asks him if he knows where the Krusty Krab is, but said fish, Sal, says he has never heard of it. SpongeBob tells him about it, gives him coupons, and then Sal goes there on his truck without SpongeBob. SpongeBob cries, remembers to use his landmarks, and then tries to go back where he came from, but cannot remember too well. He finds the broken fire hydrant he found previously, but then he notices many broken fire hydrants.\nSpongeBob then finds a payphone and calls Squidward for help. The operator interrupts the call and tells him that if he wants to continue the call, he needs to insert another dime, but he does not have one. He spots an abandoned sofa and then sees three tough-looking fish drinking soda, and SpongeBob tries to reach under the cushions of said sofa to see if there are any dimes, but instead, he finds two nickels.\nOne of the fish, Scott, asks him what he is doing, and SpongeBob tells him that he is looking for a dime. Scott shouts at SpongeBob and says that he drives a pedicab, so the latter hops into the former's pedicab and tells him that he needs to go to the Krusty Krab. Scott drops him off to what he thinks is the restaurant, but it turns out to be The Krusty Klam.\nSpongeBob begins frantically running, checks his watch, and then starts to make another shortcut, which causes him great pain, but finally finds the Krusty Krab for him. He crawls to it and enters, and then hugs two customers and kisses one of the elderly customers. He finds Patrick there and asks him how he got to the restaurant. Patrick says that Scott gave him a ride, which he always does, and Scott is seen outside waving at SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs appears and says that SpongeBob is scaring his customers away with his foul stench and tells him to go home and take a bath. Squidward protests that that was his thing, but Mr. Krabs says that the former is clean. As a result, Squidward starts to roll around in the dirt and asks where his bubble bath is. Mr. Krabs sprays Squidward with a hose as Sal shortly comes to the Krusty Krab on his truck and runs over a puddle, which splashes onto Squidward. Mr. Krabs orders Squidward back to work and Sal asks about the coupon. Mr. Krabs then says it is actually another fee, and Sal realizes his error, but still wants food.

A few seconds pass and he makes it with flying colors. Now it is SpongeBob's turn. He is just about to take the wheel when the police show up. Apparently, it is against the law to let a snail, or any other animal drive a boat, especially in dangerous places.

By then, a defective storm dashes upon Bikini Bottom, and the Krusty crew is stuck inside the building. Until then, Mr. Krabs decides to share one of his stories about a time when a gusty wind tossed around his cargo ship. Mr. Krabs was cooking up some food for his crew, and during his cookery, Captain Scarfish burst into the kitchen telling Mr. Krabs to refrain from making delicious food, and to keep the crust on the bread. He was explaining to him that he has a cargo load full of sun tan lotion. Soon into the story, Mr. Krabs brings in a load of slob for the hungry fish.\nAfter seeing the poorly looking fish eating the slop, Mr. Krabs feels bad for them as the crew glare at Mr. Krabs, very upset with him for making such a nasty slop. Finally fed up with captain's cruel and ruthless orders, Mr. Krabs determines to turn the nourishment into a tasty treat, which gets seen by the captain, who gets furious and decides to send him to jail. After sharing about his horrible journey to prison, Mr. Krabs gives the foolish guard an assignment to make a cathedral of cotton candy so that he can snatch a piece while he is distracted and form a key to unlock the cell. At that moment, Mr. Krabs made a wise decision until he sees that the jail is being under hostage by the pirates. He knew he had to act fast, so he unlocked his way out and told the crew to wake up. Unfortunately, much to his dismay, the SpongeBob guard is still asleep and the crew (including the octopus sailor) are very sick, courtesy of Scarfish's ruthlessness.\nMr. Krabs was on his own. He had to poke holes in the barrels of sun tan lotion to keep the other fish on the island alive. While threatened to be attacked, the guard used piles of moldy crust to form cannon balls to shoot at the ship. After the pirates' sail sunk down, the guard poked holes in the barrels of suntan lotion to keep the other fish on the island from getting disintegrated. The fish soon revive and swam upon the cargo, to capture the pirates.\nThe pirate is put behind bars, and Mr. Krabs gives her a pie with a key molded from cotton candy.\nThe episode ends with Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob continuously winking at each other, which deeply annoys Squidward."}

Squidward tells SpongeBob that Mr. Krabs only cares about the profits as SpongeBob disbelieves that explanation, but Mr. Krabs quickly confirms to SpongeBob that Squidward's reason as to why he is so overjoyed is correct. Mr. Krabs explains that this is the time of the year where he gets the most money due to him being the supplier of the Krabby Patties. An unbeatable challenger named Oswald McNulty has won every Krabby Patty eating contest, and beaten every single city champion except Bikini Bottom. Mr. Krabs gets excited before Squidward tells him he only has to sell one patty as the latter questions the meaning of this.\nSquidward berates his boss for not reading the paper and shows it to him to and reveal only one patty is needed. Mr. Krabs is devastated by the news, as he believes he is not going to get any revenue until he sees Patrick, who comes in to order 47 Krabby Patties as a light lunch while stupidly mistaking a broom for Squidward. Taking advantage of Patrick's naïve nature, Mr. Krabs then proposes that Patrick becomes the next Krabby Patty eating champion, and Patrick agrees. After Patrick takes too long eating, Mr. Krabs sees how McNulty eats the patty by not chewing. He then begins Patrick's training by making him eat Krabby Patties without tasting them, to his sadness and SpongeBob's worry. While training, he sees a young boy with a broken foot with his father. The father's son asks Patrick a question, and Patrick tries to answer, but Mr. Krabs tells the crowd to see him at the Krusty Krab.\nThe contest is about to start, the crowd is outside of the Krusty Krab and two guards carry Oswald, who is sitting on a chair being lifted by the guards, then the crowd starts booing, including the boy with the broken foot and his father.\nThe contest is shortly going to start, and when SpongeBob asks the competitors if they are ready, Patrick says he does not want to do it. SpongeBob says, \"Well then don't do it, I'm sure Mr. Krabs will understand.\", but Mr. Krabs hears this. He then gives Patrick a bill, listing the Krabby Patties Patrick ate for training. He says that they have just become plain eating patties, and Mr. Krabs says if he does the contest he will not have to pay the bill, then Mr. Krabs points to the crowd cheering for Patrick and the boy with a broken foot is in the crowd, so Patrick says that he will do it for him. Then Mr. Krabs tears up the bill.\nThe contest begins, and Oswald is eating the patties already, but Patrick is struggling and is barely eating any of the patties. Patrick looks at the crowd, seeing the boy with the broken foot cheering Patrick on. Patrick becomes encouraged by that, and then eats a whole entire plate of patties. Oswald starts eating faster, both of them start eating faster, all until they are tied at 999 patties eaten with one minute left until the contest ends, but both stop. Oswald falls from his chair. Patrick tells SpongeBob he cannot continue, but SpongeBob reminds Patrick of the taste, then Patrick gets encouraged to eat one last Krabby Patty to win. Patrick then points to the boy with a broken foot, and the boy gives Patrick the last patty. Patrick eats the patty before the minute is up, then wins the contest.\nPatrick is handed the belt, and puts it on. Perch Perkins asks Patrick if he is going to enter the contest again next year, but Patrick says no, and says the belt does not even fit.

Larry advises SpongeBob to always stay hydrated and gives him a bottle of water, which SpongeBob drinks and his cramps heal. Larry then agrees to personally train SpongeBob, but only if he signs a lifetime membership, which he does (with some difficulty). Larry walks SpongeBob over to the exercise equipment and SpongeBob (after seeing Mr. Krabs barely lifting a large set of weights) starts to doubt himself, saying he cannot lift weights. Larry, upon hearing this, puts cotton balls on a cotton swab to see if SpongeBob can lift it, but SpongeBob is not able to lift it. SpongeBob continues to stay hydrated while Larry walks SpongeBob over to where he leads his exercise class the next day. Larry then decides to show SpongeBob some crunches, but SpongeBob simply laughs as he doing this.

{"prompt": "The Fish Bowl", "completion": "The episode starts off with Sandy sitting in her pool lounge chair listening to music, when suddenly, a book she ordered arrives at her dome. The book is about behavioral psychology, which Sandy uses to observe the behavior of fishes underwater. She begins off by riding a bus full of fish, who seem to act naturally. However, she disturbs and annoys the Bikini Bottomites by eavesdropping and reading her observations out loud. The fish throw her and her equipment out of the bus and she decides to find someone who will not mind being observed. She then sees SpongeBob and Patrick playing with each other, and decides to ask them. The two do not know what they are supposed to do during natural observance and just stand straight while saying actions and forms of the word \"natural.\" They are also very nervous due to the microphone and recorder; their nervousness immediately goes away when Sandy ends her experiment. Despite her experiment being unsuccessful, she gives them both an A+ for their effort, and when they start cheering, she observes them again, only to provoke the same reaction. She proceeds to give up.\nReading from the book again, Sandy learns that the test subject will behave abnormally if they are aware that they are being watched and may cause inaccurate results, so she decides to watch them in secret. She starts off by assigning them to go to the beach, to fill one bucket with white sand and one bucket with black sand to count. She also puts Patrick in charge. After that, Sandy hides microphones and cameras everywhere, puts Gary in charge of spying on the two, and observes the cameras from a van disguised as an ice cream truck.\nWhen SpongeBob and Patrick get back home, Patrick is unable to stop thinking about being in charge. SpongeBob asks which method they will use to count the sand, but Patrick does not pay attention and continues to think about the phrase \"I'm in charge.\" After SpongeBob asks how he wants to count the sand, he simply says that first suggestion, which is both of them counting the white sand first and then the black sand. While counting the sand, Patrick continues to think about being in charge and imagines himself running an organization called \"Patrick Corp.\" When SpongeBob snaps him back into reality, having been stuck at 47 grains, Patrick decides he does not like how they are doing it and has SpongeBob count the black sand while he counts the white sand. He has trouble counting the sand, but SpongeBob does it flawlessly. Patrick then makes the error of missing the digit in the tens place as SpongeBob has the same digit in the ones place as him, causing him to get frustrated with SpongeBob.\nSandy then starts her second experiment by putting two scoops of the same amount of ice cream into two different sized bowls to confuse Patrick, which she gives to the two disguised as a mustached ice cream man. Squidward tries to get the ice cream, but when he comes, Sandy says the ice cream is sold out and slams the window on his nose, leaving him annoyed. Patrick likes the bigger bowl but believes the ice cream in the other bowl is bigger, and SpongeBob and Patrick constantly trade before Patrick says the only way for it to be fair is for him to eat both, causing SpongeBob to protest before Patrick selfishly reminds him that he is in charge.\nSandy then begins observing them both in her third experiment, when she hands them two ice cream cones exactly the same size. Squidward again tries to get the ice cream, but she says that they are sold out again and slams the window on his leg. Patrick takes both cones and SpongeBob begs to have his but Patrick forces him to rub his feet and then count the sand while his ice cream melts. SpongeBob then counts the black sand after finishing with the white sand, but Patrick cruelly knocks over the bucket and mixes it all together, forcing him to start over. Angry, SpongeBob gives Patrick's ice cream \"sprinkles\" by covering it with white sand, only for Patrick to retaliate by dropping his ice cream in the sand and eating SpongeBob's melted ice cream whole, finally causing SpongeBob's patience to run out.\nSandy then realizes Patrick is taking advantage of his privileges and taking advantage of SpongeBob due to his power of being in charge. SpongeBob angrily fights back, with Gary telling Sandy that the situation is bad. She runs towards the door and asks them to open it, but they have a fight about who opens it for her and she is forced to break the door down. Still wearing the mustache, Patrick believes that she is a real ice cream lady, and asks her to tell SpongeBob to open the door. She then reveals herself to Patrick, shocking him. Sandy reveals her experiment towards SpongeBob and Patrick. She shows them the cameras and microphones which leads to their affected behavior again, with SpongeBob upset that Gary was in on it too.\nUpon hearing this, Patrick realizes that he got carried away with being in charge and apologizes to SpongeBob for his selfish behavior with him saying that he deserved a C-. SpongeBob tells him not to be so hard on himself as it was the experiment's fault, causing Patrick to blame science. Sandy tells them that they all get an A+ and ice cream. Squidward starts begging for a drop of the ice cream which Sandy, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Gary all ate, and they end up observing Squidward's desire for the ice cream in the house, now revealed to be a cage, as the episode ends."}

Mr. Krabs mentions that he knows one... but for delicious kisses. He then proceeds to kiss Cashina, but Plankton quickly presses a button that replaces her lips with ones that electrocute him on contact. Nevertheless, he took the kiss well.\nAt Mr. Krabs' house, Pearl finds out about his relationship with Cashina and disapproves it, claiming that she doesn't want a stepmother like the ones she saw in the movies because then she won't get her \"Prince Charming.\" In an attempt to change her mind, Mr. Krabs introduces Pearl to Cashina. However, Pearl immediately doesn't like her and storms off to her bedroom. Mr. Krabs wants to talk to Pearl, but Cashina says that she will do it alone.

A teardrop falls on Cashina, causing her to malfunction and explode, revealing Plankton inside it. Mr. Krabs, shocked at the revelation, starts to get angry, but then gets depressed. He says that he's been alone for so long and that it was the first time that he fell for someone, and that although Cashina wasn't real, his feelings were. Plankton just concludes that he was being crazy and runs out of the room, declaring that he will get the formula one day. Mr. Krabs breaks down sobbing, and a bellhop tries to console him, only to say that he has to tip him. Mr. Krabs then stashes away the money from when Cashina exploded and gives the bellhop a nickel and when he caught it the nickel landed in a bowl of pea soup, as the episode ends."}

SpongeBob sees this and gets the idea to sell frozen Krabby Patties, speculating that people will love them because of how convenient they are. Mr. Krabs hears this and decides to carry out with this idea that he humorously claims to have had, before SpongeBob said it.\nMr. Krabs, along with the help of SpongeBob and his daughter Pearl, create their own well-intentioned, albeit cheaply made, advertisement for the Frozen Krabby Patty, which he presents to the businessman, Don Grouper, who is not particularly impressed with their \"commercial.\" Being mindful of the immense potential that this idea has, he decides to help Mr. Krabs create an ad campaign to promote the Frozen Krabby Patties. Grouper hypothesizes that in order to create a successful ad, they would need someone who could represent the target audience for this new product, which would make the commercial itself more relatable and therefore memorable.\nThe new face of Frozen Krabby Patties ends up being Patrick Star. After the first commercial airs, Grouper soon tells Mr. Krabs that he is bound to make a lot of money, but he will make even more if he changes the recipe and adds some \"filler,\" much to SpongeBob's dismay. He then gives Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob a tour of the factory where these new patties are made. While touring, SpongeBob notices the workers using sand in the recipe for the patties, which Mr. Krabs tells him to ignore. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs gets his first revenue check for the Frozen Krabby Patties, which puts him in a state of bliss. The new patties are a monstrous success, and everyone seems to be enjoying them, despite some noticeable side effects.\nMr. Krabs fires SpongeBob from his fry cook job and immediately rehires him to work in the Krusty Krab Museum, which documents the complete history of the Krusty Krab, complete with animatronic versions of the employees, and merchandise, which includes the Frozen Krabby Patties themselves. Mr. Krabs decides to celebrate his new fortune by eating one, but by the look on his face, the new patty seems to taste disgusting. However, Mr. Krabs is in denial because of how well everything is going, so he decides to grin and bear it. Squidward is then fired by Mr. Krabs, but unlike SpongeBob, he does not get a job at the museum. Squidward takes solace in the fact that he can finally live out his dreams of becoming a ballet dancer, playing clarinet in the orchestra, and writing a mystery-thriller novel. SpongeBob is noticeably disheartened, but he decides to make the best of this situation, while Mr. Krabs swims in a pool of coins.\nPatrick becomes a major celebrity due to the success of the new commercials, but because of this, his friendship with SpongeBob seems to be slowly fading and both best friends even have less time to hang out with each other.

SpongeBob tries to have some fun with his friend, but Patrick is pulled away for an important photo shoot, looking as sad as SpongeBob. Also, Patrick's 400th commercial is coming up soon, which makes everyone else very excited.\nSpongeBob dejectedly heads back to the museum, where he surprisingly finds Squidward, who was not successful in his quest to make his dreams come true due to being under-qualified, and asks for a job at the museum. SpongeBob says how Squidward could help out with the animatronic Squidward because he notices something about him is off due to his friendlier attitude, so Squidward decides to replace it with himself acting like a robot, he takes back his hat and destroys robot (by simply pushing him to the ground).\nLater on, Plankton comes by and tries to take the formula, but he is confused when the bored SpongeBob does not do anything to stop him. SpongeBob tells him that there is no point in stopping him because all the formulas in the restaurant are blank souvenirs. Plankton then asks for a Frozen Krabby Patty, which SpongeBob obliges to. Plankton then runs off with the frozen patty. Squidward asks SpongeBob if they should chase Plankton because he did not pay. SpongeBob tells Squidward that the patties are not the same as before, and by eating one, he discovers that they are made of sand, which was the \"filler\" that SpongeBob heard about before from Don Grouper.\nFilled with an overwhelming sense of determination, SpongeBob reads the real secret formula and cooks up a fresh one, and then runs over to Patrick. Patrick notices him, and they start running towards each other, with SpongeBob yelling to him that the new Frozen Krabby Patties are made of sand. Patrick does not hear him at first until SpongeBob uses the phone to tell him that and he says he thought he recognized the taste.

But first, Patrick is called to make an opening speech, since he is the official mascot of the frozen sandwich. After a bit of inner conflict, Patrick reveals that the patties are made of sand, which exposes Don Grouper as a fraud. Soon, everyone in the audience begins to violently vomit up sand, as well as everyone else in Bikini Bottom once the news is revealed to them.\nThe depressed Mr. Krabs wanders over to the Krusty Krab, where he is confused when he sees that it is filled with customers. He goes into the kitchen and sees SpongeBob and Patrick cooking the patties. Mr. Krabs asks why everyone is eating the patties when they know they are made of sand. SpongeBob confirms this fact, but says the ones they are eating now are the fresh, homemade patties that they love. Mr. Krabs asks SpongeBob how much him and Patrick are charging for the patties, which turns out to be nothing at all. Mr. Krabs then makes a deal with SpongeBob that he can be their boss again and charge actual money for the patties.

The customers ask him if they can go home, but he announces that no one is leaving until they order something. Buddy calls Mr. Krabs a tyrant, which results in him berating and belittling everyone in the restaurant. SpongeBob wonders why Mr. Krabs is in such a sour mood, with Squidward pointing out that the reason is most likely out of pettiness to the fact that it is \"pay day,\" the day in which he actually must pay his employees. Mr. Krabs then announces that he is not going to pay them, and that he is the captain of the restaurant and everyone has to do what he says or else.\nSuddenly, a sunken ship gets its anchor attached to the roof and sends the restaurant hurdling into the rip current. Mr. Krabs realizes his arthritis was messing up his detector and he was wrong. Fortunately, SpongeBob manages to safely steer the Krusty Krab and save the customers. As SpongeBob steers, Squidward announces that everything is under control. The customers praise him a hero and make him the new captain. Mr. Krabs is offended by this and the customers plan on getting revenge on him for his actions and harsh treatment. SpongeBob stops the feud and lectures them about the good things Mr. Krabs did. The customers come to see that even though Mr. Krabs can be a tyrant, he is still a good person and eventually agree to go easy on him.\nHowever, since there is no one to steer the restaurant, Mr. Krabs is sent flying outside. The customers blame Squidward for losing Mr. Krabs, when all of a sudden, the restaurant flies off course and lands in the middle of a forest. Everything seems safe for everyone and they start to discuss what they should do. However, a horrifying monster comes and starts attacking everyone. SpongeBob asks Squidward to protect the customers since he is the captain, but Squidward claims that he cannot fight. The customers insist and take Squidward outside to fight the monster. But once they throw him out, he ends up getting eaten instead.\nSpongeBob decides to fight the monster himself until Mr. Krabs unexpectedly arrives. SpongeBob and the customers beg Mr. Krabs to fight the monster, but he selfishly refuses and turns his back on them like a spoiled child. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that if he does not save them, then he will destroy his first dime. After many failed attempts, SpongeBob is about to do the worst thing he can do to his dime: spending it on candy. Mr. Krabs reluctantly agrees that he will save the customers, but only if they promise to let him be the captain and spend all of their money in the restaurant. Mr. Krabs goes outside and defeats the monster, freeing Squidward in the process. SpongeBob rewards Mr. Krabs for his heroic efforts while Mr. Krabs rewards SpongeBob a pay day for not giving up on him. Squidward and the customers are then forced to pull the Krusty Krab back to Bikini Bottom while SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs sit on the roof, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "The Whole Tooth", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob and Patrick are having fun chewing on some saltwater taffy at Salmon Sal The Taffy Pal in the Bikini Bottom Fair. Patrick pulls some sweets in his mouth when suddenly, he begins to feel pain and assumes that it has something to do with his teeth. SpongeBob suggests that Patrick should go to the dentist. Although Patrick does not want to because he is afraid of the dentist, he reluctantly goes.\nAt the dentist's office, Dr. Mundane checks Patrick's teeth and finds that he still has a baby tooth. He tells Patrick that to make the pain stop, he needs to extract the tooth so the adult tooth can grow in its place. But Patrick refuses to let his tooth go. As they head home, SpongeBob tells Patrick about Tooth Island, a place where the Tooth Fairy sends baby teeth after being extracted from someone's mouth. Patrick still refuses to leave his baby tooth and claims that he knows what is best for it.\nAs time goes by, Patrick continues to suffer pain in his mouth and finally decides to get his tooth to the Tooth Fairy. Squidward, who does not believe in the Tooth Fairy, rants that there is no such thing. He bets that if SpongeBob and Patrick could prove that if there is a Tooth Fairy, he will eat a bucket of raw chum meat, which disgusts them. SpongeBob suggests to have Patrick's tooth removed, but Patrick does not want to and runs away. SpongeBob pursues Patrick in a chase and finally catches him. When SpongeBob shows him photos of how SpongeBob's teeth were handled, Patrick finally decides that it is time to have his tooth removed.\nDr. Mundane successfully extracts the tooth, and at night, Patrick puts his tooth under the pillow so he can go to Tooth Island. While Patrick is sleeping, SpongeBob sneaks in to take Patrick's tooth. However, he gets caught by Squidward, thinking that he proved the Tooth Fairy is not real. Patrick is disappointed and believes that SpongeBob has betrayed him. But SpongeBob does not believe that and takes Patrick and Squidward to the docks. There, he shows them the real Tooth Ferry, which turns out to be a cruise ship. Patrick is overjoyed, says good-bye to his tooth, and gets a dollar, which he tells SpongeBob to put under his pillow for tomorrow. After the ship departs, SpongeBob and Patrick punish Squidward for trying to ruin their friendship (and ranting that the ferry does not exist) and force him to eat a bucket of chum meat as he bet earlier, which results in him in losing his teeth, which swim to the Tooth Ferry, as the episode ends."}

Intrigued, they buy the toy and fly their brains around town to spy on citizens and pull pranks.\nAfter getting eggs thrown at them, a kid tells SpongeBob and Patrick that everyone has Whirly Brains and not just them. Patrick, SpongeBob, and the unnamed kid race, but SpongeBob and Patrick's brains land into an old man's house and he takes them as his own. After literally losing their minds, SpongeBob and Patrick (the latter seemingly figuratively losing his) begin to panic, as they cannot find their brains. With an idea, SpongeBob calls Sandy on the phone and she uses a missing brain detector to find the brains.\nSandy's detector leads to the same old man who found their brains. She asks kindly, but the old man is snoring. However, Sandy just walks in and they try to look for the brains. The floor creaks and he wakes up, but Sandy puts a fight with the old man. SpongeBob accidentally trips onto the barrel, and all of the brains fly free, and all of them go back to their original beings.\nSandy is about to threaten the old man, who immediately cries out an apology before revealing he hoarded the toys because he cannot stand seeing everyone have fun while he stands there with his cane. However, Sandy and SpongeBob hook the latter's propeller onto the old man so he can fly in the air too.\nIt frightens the lady fishes, as they run around in circles at the Shady Shoals Rest Home building.

{"prompt": "Mermaid Pants", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, SpongeBob and Patrick play Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, in their costumes. They drive in the invisible car, pretending it is the invisible boatmobile and think Squidward's house is an evil lair. They climb, and Squidward sees them. He then cuts their rope, and they fall to the ground. They think Squidward is Dr. Negative, while Squidward sings a song about how much he hates his neighbors.\nSquidward is then seen watering his garden, who SpongeBob and Patrick think is raising mutant vegetables to attack. While Squidward goes to refill his water, SpongeBob and Patrick destroy Squidward's garden, making a salad and eating it, which angers Squidward in the process. He breaks his legs in frustration, then loses his balance and falls down.\nAt the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Patrick sing the Mermaid Man/Barnacle Boy song, annoying Squidward. He tells them the song is stupid, causing SpongeBob and Patrick to transform into their costumes and call him Dr. Negative again. Patrick thinks that a nearby fish has been injured, but he really just has toilet paper attached to his foot from the bathroom. Patrick gets out his first aid kit and they mummify the fish and put him in a wheelchair. Patrick then burns the fish's eyes with peroxide. Angered, the fish moves away. Squidward then tells them they have to take the trash out.\nSpongeBob and Patrick punch the trash and it lands on the customers and they leave angered. Mr. Krabs is angry that all his customers are gone and he calls Squidward into his office. He shows his secret room, with comic books, and also with a suit that Krabs sewed up himself. Krabs then puts on the suit, called Captain Tightwad, with Squidward playing the doctor. Krabs sends out lassos to attack SpongeBob and Patrick, but all of them miss. He then throws Squidward at SpongeBob, and he gets stuck. He manages to break free, but spins out and knocks objects, including money. SpongeBob then questions their fighting and opens up his comic book, which states that no superhero should fight a bad guy until the bad guy commits a crime. Mr. Krabs then steals his own money, but SpongeBob is not stupid to realize that.\nThe setting then changes to a bank, where Krabs pretends to rob the bank. An old man tells him that the ATM is outside, but then attacks Squidward and Krabs after they said they were pretending to rob the bank. At night, the Krusty Krab, now called the Lair, has transformed into a scientific evil lab. SpongeBob has a crime scene set so they can play, but Squidward takes it seriously, thinking it is his chance to knock his neighbors out. He actually lowers the lever on the trap, sending SpongeBob and Patrick down towards boiling grease. Squidward wants them to fry, but Krabs gives up because Squidward is literally playing the bad guy. SpongeBob and Patrick free themselves by tipping the lift, but Squidward and Krabs get fried and The Krusty Krab is now destroyed.\nIn the end, Krabs sticks to reading comic books and SpongeBob and Patrick fake drive into the distance. The TV Announcer says he needs to find another job and asks if it is too late to go back to college radio."}
{"prompt": "Unreal Estate", "completion": "The episode starts with SpongeBob scraping barnacles off of his pineapple home. Squidward is painting a picture of him asking standing over SpongeBob and Patrick. He gets distracted by the noise going on outside and goes out to stop it. SpongeBob's hose starts flailing all over the place and fills Squidward up with water. A few kids think he is a sprinkler and come to play in the water. SpongeBob then proceeds to turn the hose water off, much to the kids' dismay. Squidward takes the hose out of his mouth, causing it to sag, then he tells SpongeBob what he was trying to say, but the latter misses the point and turns it back on, then off again.\nAfter being irritated by this occurrence, Squidward tells SpongeBob that everything he does is horrible and that he should move away. This leads SpongeBob to tearing up and reminiscing the memories he and his (supposedly anthropomorphic) house have shared together throughout the years. As a result, he refuses to move away. Desperate for him too, Squidward tries to convince SpongeBob that he is allergic to his own home. Although SpongeBob sneezes a few times, he finds this statement rather silly and goes back inside.\nLater that day, Squidward breaks into SpongeBob's house while he is sleeping and fills the hole of his foghorn alarm clock with pepper as a means to get him to develop allergies to his pineapple and thus move away. Although he succeeds, Gary catches Squidward in this act and engages in a brutal fight with him, to which SpongeBob adores and deems \"playtime.\" The following day, SpongeBob wakes up to his alarm clock emitting the aroma of pepper, causing him to sneeze constantly. He then tries to cook eggs for breakfast, also releasing sneezes. The sneezing process continues when he is in the shower and trying to shave, which causes him to remove part of his skin rather than his beard.\nAfter failing to get better, SpongeBob thinks that what Squidward said the other day might have been true and finally agrees to move out and go house hunting with him.\nSquidward recommends various homes for him: a banana, a hot pepper, a chicken parmesan hero house, a coffin, a dresser, and a fish tank located in a seafood restaurant; the first three are accompanied by SpongeBob imagining his life in the houses with parodies of the show's theme song playing in each fantasy. SpongeBob does not find any of these appealing, harming him along the way, especially the last of the six, due to being located in a restaurant that serves fish. However, he finally finds one that catches his interest due to its fancy atmosphere. Squidward admires the house too, and as such convinces SpongeBob that the home is not suitable for him because it is too fancy and will thus force him to struggle through the lifestyle of fame. As a result, Squidward offers him his own house so the former can relax and indulge in the atmosphere without the annoyance of SpongeBob. Unbeknownst to this, SpongeBob thanks Squidward and bids him farewell prior to leaving.\nSquidward later feels relieved, finally being able to sleep peacefully without the annoying antics of SpongeBob and Patrick. However, when he wakes up the following day, it is revealed that the \"house\" is actually a spaceship when Squidward realizes that the \"alarm clock\" is actually a timer. He is then launched into space, much to his anger, and the landing of the ship only makes matters worse for him.\nSquidward lands back on Conch Street, angrily demanding that SpongeBob give him his Easter Island Head house back, which is now painted to resemble SpongeBob's pineapple As The Color Orange. SpongeBob refuses and suggests that he go find somewhere else to reside otherwise he'll have nowhere else to live (because he cannot go back to the pineapple due to his allergies). Squidward then resorts to living in SpongeBob's own pineapple, but he cannot since Patrick now lives there and is munching on a majority of the house. Squidward now realizes that making SpongeBob move out was not a good idea. Much to his reluctance, this leaves him no choice but to live under Patrick's rock, which falls down on him and squishes his nose, leading him to let out a pained groan as the episode ends."}

SpongeBob lets Squidward ride with him to the hospital.\nSquidward goes into his hospital room, with SpongeBob closely following. SpongeBob realizes how drab the room is and brightens it up with plushies and flowers. Irritated, Squidward yells at SpongeBob and tells him to go volunteer to be a candy striper. SpongeBob grabs his uniform and eats the literal candy strings on it. A couple of doctors passing by see SpongeBob in his white shirt and mistake him for a doctor and tell him to come along and help them. They bring SpongeBob into a room with a catfish. The catfish tells them in a gravelly voice that his throat hurts. SpongeBob reaches into the fish's neck fold and finds a clump of dirt. He then reaches into the catfish's mouth and pulls out some car keys. SpongeBob then explains how the fish is a bottom feeder and how they probably ate the keys in a search for food, stating that this also happens to his best friend, Patrick, all the time.\nSpongeBob is then moved into another room with an athlete with broken legs. The athlete asks if he will be able to run in an upcoming marathon. One doctor begins to say, \"no,\" but SpongeBob insists he can fix it. He grabs a nearby skeleton model and shoves it inside of the patient. The patient's legs are healed and he runs out of his room. The two doctors are amazed. As a result, they bring SpongeBob into the final room.\nThe room contains a deflated Mrs. Puff inside of an iron lung. SpongeBob mistakes the lung for a submarine and hops on top of it. He starts pushing and pressing levers and buttons and the Lung streaks down the hallway. It crashes into the end and shoots out a puffed up Puff. She thanks him for helping her recover, but says he still will not get a driver's license.\nThe doctors are befuddled and allow SpongeBob to perform surgery. The surgery patient ends up being Squidward. SpongeBob tries several different noses, but Squidward does not like any of them. SpongeBob then reverts his nose back to normal, but says he needed the rest of his body to make it, much to Squidward's horror. SpongeBob now has to leave for work, but the doctors tell him that he already is. However, SpongeBob tells them that his actual job is a fry cook, and he walks to the Krusty Krab.

SpongeBob believes this lie and decides to mimic/imitate people because he heard that \"imitation plus flattery equals happy people.\" He first imitates a father yelling at his kids. The father and the kids become impressed with SpongeBob's mimicry. SpongeBob then imitates Squidward, who also likes his imitation. He then imitates Patrick, who thinks he is looking at his real self.\nSpongeBob then imitates Sandy and Plankton, while they are playing a game of chess. Sandy admires the imitation, but Plankton says that he got his voice incorrect. He also imitates the French Narrator by reading the \"80,000 Impressions Later...\" time card in his voice as the narrator complains about it.\nAfter a while, SpongeBob's imitation of everyone starts to get annoying, as everyone tries to persuade him to stop, but he gets a thing called \"Mocking Mimicry Madness\" and ends up forgetting who he truly is. SpongeBob's friends attempt to help, but they only make matters worse, as SpongeBob happens to mimic all of them at once, much to their disgust and horror. Sandy tries to get SpongeBob to come back to his senses, though her attempts cause him to have a breakdown of several imitations and he leaves town calling himself a freak.\nSpongeBob goes to live in a cave in regrets of not remembering himself. His friends find him and end up mimicking him in order to bring back SpongeBob. It ends up working, but the others get the Mocking Mimicry Madness as well and end up acting like SpongeBob.

He later names the worm Prickles, after the prickly sensation the worm has on his head.\nLater, while SpongeBob continues to sleep, Prickles gives the all-clear to other worms about the good residential worm area and they all later party inside SpongeBob's head. Gary, being completely fed up with the new worms, kicks SpongeBob out of the door as well as throwing his pants and deodorant to SpongeBob. After doing his morning routines outside his house, he goes to work at the Krusty Krab. He tells all of the worms not to appear outside during his work time, or else he will risk losing his job.\nAt the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs notices SpongeBob with many worms peeking out of SpongeBob's pores. He warns SpongeBob against having worms on his body. However, the worms ignore Mr. Krabs' warnings and throw their trash onto the patty stove. Mr. Krabs soon loses his temper and fires SpongeBob immediately until SpongeBob gets the worm issue under control.\nWalking outside, SpongeBob meets Plankton on the way. He explains to him that he got fired from having worms around him. Plankton asks SpongeBob if he could remove the worms in exchange for a deed for Plankton himself, which SpongeBob agrees to. However, when Plankton tries to get rid of all of the worms, he ends up being crippled and surrenders.\nSpongeBob walks to his neighborhood and asks Patrick for help, but he refuses because of SpongeBob's scary appearance. Then he asks Squidward for help, but quickly hoses on SpongeBob in attempt to get the worms out of SpongeBob, and even Gary barricaded SpongeBob's house (and possibly locked the door) to prevent SpongeBob from coming in until the worms are gone.\nSpongeBob, now sitting by himself, and at the edge of insanity, declares himself to be \"SpongeBob WormPants\" and laughs at the new name he has given to himself.

The plan works, and he throws the can to a mailfish to send faraway.\nUnfortunately, Prickles no longer has a house as he sent the clam away using the can of beans. At night, he is wandering around, only to realize that the clam has escaped the can.

The birthday kid intentionally hits Mr. Krabs with the bat, instead of the piñata, causing money to fall out. Mr. Krabs angrily asks if he looks like a piñata, and the kid confirms this and leads the other children in a charge, causing Mr. Krabs to run. A child wearing spiked shoes appears, causing SpongeBob to tell him to take them off, but the child ignores this, making him burst.\nThe Krusty Krew realizes the kids are too wild, so Mr. Krabs throws the birthday kid as his crew makes a break for it. As the four run away, they cross paths with Ms. Mildred, a wealthy woman who asks them if they are high-class caterers she hired for a party. Mr. Krabs, seizing the opportunity to make money, lies that they are and uses Squidward's ink to make them fancy tuxedos. Mildred pays them with a large check, and when SpongeBob questions Mr. Krabs' motive, the latter silences his employees by threatening to return to the chaotic birthday party. He then has them prepare for the party.\nThe crew is mesmerized by the fancy sights and people as Squidward remarks that the high class would not believe their food is appetizing. Mr. Krabs agrees, and sends SpongeBob out to fancy the food. Krabs then looks around to see what people they are serving just as the birthday child appears in his clothes again, demanding his cake.

The other customers agree, and they start chanting \"SpongeBob's Place!\" A jealous Mr. Krabs tries to get them to chant \"Krusty Krab\" instead, but they ignore him. SpongeBob tries to give the chant some juice, but this only makes the customers resume the chant of \"SpongeBob's Place!\" Squidward tells Mr. Krabs that he would be nothing without SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs asserts Squidward that that is not true, as he is the one who created the Krabby Patty, only for the customers to carry SpongeBob by on a throne, singing \"Let's all go to SpongeBob's Place.\" This makes Mr. Krabs infuriated at SpongeBob's success.\nLater, Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that the Krusty Krab is haunted and needs ghostbusting. SpongeBob agrees to stay away until the ghost busting is done. Squidward easily sees through Mr. Krabs' lie and quickly deduces the real reason for sending SpongeBob home, which Mr. Krabs confirms by announcing that he is going to be doing the cooking from now on.\nMeanwhile, at SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob quickly gets bored and decides to make Krabby Patties at home. People smell the patties and, after eating them, insist that he make more.\nMeanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is having no such luck. The customers keep sending back their Krabby Patties. Squidward tells him that it is because they are not as good as they used to be, to which Mr. Krabs retorts that it is the same formula. One of the customers looks inside the kitchen and afterwards announces to the other customers that SpongeBob is not in the kitchen. This announcement makes the other customers angry to the point where they decide to leave. To keep them from leaving, Mr. Krabs dresses up like SpongeBob and the customers actually fall for the paper-thin disguise.\nUnfortunately, his food is still poorly made to the point where it tastes disgusting. However, the customers say they like it for SpongeBob's sake. Not realizing that they are not being sincere, Mr. Krabs reveals himself and states that it is his food that they are \"enjoying.\" This angers the customers to the point where they drop the act and flat out tell him they find his food disgusting and once again try to leave.\nMr. Krabs tries to stop them by making a moat and filling it with molten lava, stating that anyone trying to leave will have to go through him. The customers use him as a drawbridge and leave. Squidward follows suit, and Mr. Krabs gets burned by the lava.\nWhen Squidward gets home, he finds a crowd eating Krabby Patties at SpongeBob's house, which has a sign that reads \"SpongeBob's Place\" on it. This angers Squidward, so he decides to call the health inspector. Meanwhile, in an ambulance, Mr. Krabs is having his burns tended to by paramedics. He gets out and looks around when he sees SpongeBob's home as the restaurant. This has made SpongeBob so rich he does not know what to do with all the money.\nHe gives Mr. Krabs a Krabby Patty and the taste makes Mr. Krabs realize why everyone prefers SpongeBob's Krabby Patties over his, despite the fact they use the same formula: SpongeBob's food is delicious because he prepares his Krabby Patties with tender-loving care and is in most ways an excellent cook, while Mr. Krabs is in most ways a horrible cook and prepares his food with selfishness-induced carelessness to the point where his Krabby Patties are poorly prepared and disgusting. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob he deserves his own place, but SpongeBob tells him he needs a boss, and Mr. Krabs happily obliges.

A defeated Mr. Krabs walks off, as Patrick is angry at Squidward for stopping his deal, but Squidward releases Patrick from the crane and leaves while telling Patrick that Mr. Krabs was really trying to steal his coupon.\nHearing this, Patrick becomes paranoid and believes that everyone is after his coupon, causing him to run around the town getting caught in various situations like being stomped on and being attacked by toddlers until he falls off a cliff ending up in ice cream land.\nAt the park, Patrick orders a large amazing ice cream sundae and tries to sample it before giving it to SpongeBob. However, the ice cream coupon is out-of-date, causing Patrick to throw a temper tantrum. This results in him being kicked out by one of the staff employees.\nOutside the park, the employee tells Patrick if he wants to redeem his coupon, he will have to go to the Ice Cream King, who lives at the top of the hill outside the park.\nPatrick goes to see the King, who is revealed to be a starfish who is reclusive and as clueless as him (so much that all the coupons are expired as he doesn't know the year). The Ice Cream King makes Patrick a deal. If he were to beat him in a competition, he would redeem the coupon and give Patrick the free ice cream. The two engage in a series of meaningless contests, including hair growing and ice-cream cone boxing, which ends with Patrick obtaining victory over the Ice Cream King, who agrees to honor the coupon. However, he gives Patrick a cone out of his armpit with the chocolate ice cream coming out hairy to Patrick's surprise and disgust.\nPatrick returns to SpongeBob, saying he wanted to give SpongeBob an ice cream, but it melted, so he got him a hearty-handshake (using Mr. Krabs' arm). However, SpongeBob lifts his dejected friend's spirits by showing he obtained a better-looking ice cream (similar to the one Patrick tried to get earlier) and the two friends eat the ice cream, as the episode ends.\n"}
{"prompt": "Out of the Picture", "completion": "The episode begins at the Krusty Krab, Squidward attempts to sell his paintings, demanding attention from customers, who are unfazed by his art. Larry even burns his eyes upon witnessing one of his paintings. Due to the chaos he has caused, Mr. Krabs decides to shut down the art show so Squidward will never be able to sell one of his paintings. SpongeBob, however, objects and disagrees with Mr. Krabs, stating that he bought one of his paintings. An art appraiser then comes in and says that the art will not even be worth a penny. However, he then says that art can be more valuable when the artist is out of the picture, which gives Mr. Krabs an idea to get rid of his employee.\nMr. Krabs hands Squidward a delivery bag and orders him to send it to its respective customer. Squidward goes to Antarctica and encounters a snow sponge for whom he mistakes as SpongeBob. However, it turns out that the real SpongeBob is already there, eating some ice. Afterwards, they deliver an ice-cold Krabby Patty to an arctic sperm whale, who enjoys the food's frozen nature.\nUpon returning to the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs has Squidward do another delivery, which is to the Rock Bottomites. He has SpongeBob stay behind to not ruin his plan. Squidward is dropped off to Rock Bottom and then proceed to go down a ladder to reach his destination. Squidward is freaked out by the town and asks what kind of monsters its inhabitants are, to which SpongeBob arrives and says they aren't monsters, but rather his friends. He and the monsters break into a party afterwards.\nLater on, they return to Bikini Bottom, and Squidward is ordered to do yet another delivery, this time to Mars. Squidward is stuffed in a Rocket and sent to the Planet. After touching down, he insults Mars and his words immediately angers the Martians, who eat him alive. Afterwards, Mr. Krabs is confident Squidward is gone, but SpongeBob points a UFO that drops Squidward off to mars, he is covered in green slime, affected by the events on the planet, though shortly recovers. The art appraiser then rips off the $150,000 tag off Squidward's portraits, angering Mr. Krabs for making him lose money.\nFearing punishment, Squidward quickly runs away. As a result, Mr. Krabs resorts to chasing him around with a mallet in attempt to kill Squidward.\nAfterwards, SpongeBob sneaks up on Squidward, telling him he won't get off of him until he's safe. The latter says that he won't be safe until his paintings are gone, so the former gives him a chainsaw and encourages him to destroy them. Squidward can't go through though, since he views his paintings to be far too beautiful for destruction. After his hesitation goes away, he does tear them apart. Although Mr. Krabs finds this damage to be disruptive, the art appraiser deems it the most accelerating performance art he's ever seen. Upon realizing this, Mr. Krabs eventually joins in and he and Squidward damage the property of the Krusty Krab.\nThis, however, goes too far, as the art appraiser does not put a cost to it. Eventually, the restaurant's roof falls apart and lands on the duo. The appraiser puts the merging of Mr. Krabs and Squidward on the wall in a museum and explains how he acquired a masterpiece with it. The episode ends with Squidward saying, \"I'm an artist,\" Mr. Krabs saying, \"I'm rich,\" and SpongeBob adding \"I helped,\" followed by a laugh."}
{"prompt": "Feral Friends", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, Patchy arrives on a boat to the water above Bikini Bottom, saying that he and Potty are there to witness an event happening once every 100 years. He and Potty have a little argument. After that, he takes a telescope and looks underwater.\nSandy is having a birthday party with her friends at Jellyfish Fields. Patrick eats her entire birthday cake, but SpongeBob brings a backup cake. Patrick is about to eat her backup cake in one bite again and then Sandy karate-chops a slice for everyone. Then, SpongeBob says he made the cake especially for Sandy. Squidward asks SpongeBob if it contains nuts since he is allergic. SpongeBob says that it doesn't, but he counts walnuts. Squidward then gets an allergic reaction.\nA sudden earthquake happens. A big, shiny green rock arises out of a nearby volcano and is seen floating in the sky. Everyone notices it as the moon. Sandy, however, says that the moon comes out only at night. The green moon floats above a group of fish playing with a ball, turning them into real-looking and biologically-accurate fish. Sandy notices that every sea creature (including her friends) are enchanted by the green moon. Another fish, flying a kite, turns into a real-looking fish model, and eats the kite. SpongeBob and Patrick run toward the green moon. Sandy tries to save them, but she is too late and they turn into a realistic sea sponge (albeit a kitchen-sponge shaped one) and a real sea star. They then start to crawl around. Sandy tries to warn the rest of her friends to hide from the green light, and run to the shade; however, they are enchanted by the light and do not follow. Mrs. Puff and Mr. Krabs are de-evolved by the green light into a puffer fish and scavenger crab, respectively.\nPearl is seen talking on her cellphone, saying that her friends should go outside and see that \"awesome moon.\" She takes a picture with her phone, then turns into a realistic sperm whale by the green light. The cellphone talks \"Hello? Hello, Pearl?\" until Pearl eats it. Then the green light turns Larry into a realistic lobster, now unable to lift weights.\nThe green light is about to reach Sandy and she is scared, but when it crosses her, it does nothing to her. She assumes it happens only for sea creatures, yet she doesn't understand why this green moon turns all the sea creatures into wild fish.\nShe is starting to question if she's the only one left normal. Squidward comes out of the bathroom. She runs towards him and grabs him in order to place him in the shadows, away from the green light. She throws and pushes him under a small rock. Squidward demands an explanation.\nSandy calls the French Narrator, who's in a submarine somewhere in the ocean, seen on screen in a scuba-diver suit. The French Narrator seems to know Sandy. The French Narrator stops Sandy in the middle of her sentence, saying he was looking at the green moon's actions all day. He explains about Neptune's moon and that it happens every 100 years, and the effects of Neptune's Moon lasts for 2 hours.\nSandy says she just has to keep Squidward in the shadows for two hours. Squidward peeks out from under the rock and sees several giant fish eating each other while Sandy finishes her phone call with the French Narrator. Squidward runs in panic to his house (and towards the moon) to save himself from being eaten. Sandy shouts that he needs to stay in the shadows. Squidward falls over, when a big, purple fish approaches and is about to eat him. Luckily, Neptune's Moon is passing over, turning Squidward into a big, realistic octopus, who eats the purple fish.\nSandy is afraid that Squidward will eat the rest of her friends if she doesn't act quickly. She collects them all in a jellyfishing net, then rides on Pearl's tail. During the ride, Sandy bumps into Pearl's breathing-hole, only being blown to the air and hit by an airplane. The airplane contains only non-anthropomorphic fish, including the pilots, who are unable to control the plane and cause it to crash. Sandy lands back on Pearl's tail.\nNeptune's Moon reaches the center of Bikini Bottom. Sandy tries to warn all of the fish, but no one seems to notice. An officer asking for a driving license from a driver is seen, when both fish are turned by the green light into realistic fish.\nPearl is leaving the town and goes up. Sandy warns everyone to hold on. Then, Pearl approaches Patchy's boat, who is afraid of the coming whale. He tries to sail away, but he doesn't make it, and Pearl jumps above Patchy's boat. The jump splashes water into the boat, and Patchy tries to get the water out. He unsuccessfully asks Potty for help, then shouts that Potty needs to go away. Patchy decides to do it all by himself. Pearl goes back down, and Sandy jumps off her tail when she reaches her house.\nThe scene cuts to show all of Sandy's friends in an aquarium (minus Pearl and Squidward, who are too big to contain) at her treedome when Sandy tries to feed them. Sandy picks up another phone call with the French Narrator, asking him to explain more about her fish friends. He begins to explain every creature, but, while explaining about the scavenger crab and the puffer fish, Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff fight for a while, until Sandy picks them up, saying that she knows she would have to set them apart. The French Narrator continues explaining about the creatures and Sandy takes a picture of the primitive sponge.\nSquidward suddenly shows up at Sandy's treedome and starts to climb on top of It. The French Narrator explains about the octopus. Sandy is nervous, but says that her dome is made of pressure-resistant glass, but the French Narrator warns Sandy that giant octopuses can cut through hard materials using their beaks. The scene shows Squidward cutting a hole in the dome using his beak. The water starts to fill the dome. Sandy's aquarium friends start to float around. Squidward further breaks Sandy's dome and tries to eat her and her friends. Sandy throws her friends into her tree, then tries to escape.\nSquidward succeeds to hold Sandy and to insert his mouth and teeth into her tree, getting her aquarium friends cornered. The French Narrator says something about the climax of the battle. The French Narrator reminds Sandy she must remember who the giant octopus's natural enemy is. Then she remembers, frees herself from Squidward and uses her tail to create echolocation and summon the natural enemy of the octopus, the whale. As Pearl and Squidward are fighting, Sandy's aquarium friends run towards her.\nSandy notices the 2 hours are up. The French Narrator says that Neptune's Moon goes to the other volcano and that they'll see it again in 100 years. Then, he yells \"Goal!\" like in soccer.\nEveryone turns back to normal, but due to the effects of Neptune's Moon, their clothes disappear and they end up naked. Everyone except SpongeBob and Patrick run away and SpongeBob asks Sandy why her treedome is broken and everyone's naked. Sandy responds that it has been the most interesting birthday that she ever had. The French Narrator says that after Neptune's Moon is followed by Neptune's sun. A sudden earthquake happens, followed by a red and yellow ball floating out of a volcano; which floats above Patrick, Sandy and SpongeBob. It only affects Sandy, though, and she turns into a realistic squirrel.\nThe scene goes back to the island above Bikini Bottom, where the French Narrator says that Bikini Bottom is full of life and mysteries. He says that the whale music is for his beloved squirrel. The scene shows a live-action Sandy water skiing on the surface of the water, passing by Patchy's boat. Patchy's boat is sinking, and has a shark around it. He says to Potty that he never thought he would end as a shark's meal. They both accept their end, when they realize the shark fin is actually the French Narrator in his scuba-suit. They seem to know each other.\nThe French Narrator says to Patchy that he came to warn him about Neptune's Sun, but it is too late, and goes away. Patchy does not understand what \"Neptune's Sun\" means. Then, Neptune's Sun appears above his boat, turning Patchy into a caveman and Potty into a pterodactyl (different than their \"Ugh\" designs). Prehistoric Potty thinks Patchy is a patty. He picks Patchy up and flies away, as the episode ends."}

He then finds out that Patrick is sleepwalking and that he is the cause of the mess. SpongeBob then tries to wake him up by calling his name, pulling his shorts, banging on pots and pans, using an air horn, pulling on his eyelids, and using his foghorn alarm. However, all of the attempts fail and Patrick sleepwalks towards the toaster. He puts two slices of bread in the toaster, then splatters a bar of butter on it, then he eats the toaster. He burps out toast, eats it, then walks towards the refrigerator. He eats a container, then puts a carton of eggs on his butt. He then continues to walk (with his head inside the fridge) and breaks the wall. He then takes the fridge and throws it against another wall, breaking it.\nHe starts walking through the hole, onto a road filled with driving boats. Patrick manages to make it through, but SpongeBob gets hit by a bunch of boats, then lands on the ground on the other side of the road, later getting stepped on by Patrick.\nPatrick then walks into someone's house, walks by two fish sleeping, and walks toward a bunch of glass bottles. SpongeBob quickly turns him into the other direction, then quickly picks up a pot that Patrick dropped. SpongeBob then walks into a room, seeing Patrick screaming something to some fish, but SpongeBob quickly silences him. He turns Patrick around and smacks his butt, and then Patrick walks out of the house, over to the Chum Bucket, while SpongeBob gets kicked out of the house, through the window.\nSpongeBob goes to the Chum Bucket, where Patrick is about to eat some chum. SpongeBob stops him, but ends up accidentally eating the chum himself.\nHe then follows Patrick over to the theater, where he sees Patrick sleep-dancing on the stage. SpongeBob gets some popcorn and watches him, getting teary at the end of the performance. Patrick then leaves the stage and SpongeBob follows him to Glove World!, where he is walking on the track of the Neck Breaker. SpongeBob then gets a cart and follows him on the track. SpongeBob grabs onto Patrick, and they fly off the track, right beside Patrick's rock, to which SpongeBob leads him.\nHowever, Patrick steps on a rock and wakes up in pain before he notices SpongeBob beginning to sleepwalk into traffic. Patrick (ironically) expresses little concern about this event and believes that SpongeBob won't be harmed.

The hot chocolate used to free Patrick's tongue melts all the ice and a prehistoric sponge named \"Spongy Spongy\" emerges from it. He then follows SpongeBob, fascinated by the squeaky sound of his shoes. He then hides in SpongeBob's bag for the rest of his trip.\nSpongeBob then arrives back home and leaves Patrick next to his rock with his tongue tied on a rack. SpongeBob then goes home to find Gary waiting for him. He leaves the heavy bag on a peg and Spongy Spongy jumps out. He is curious about Gary and then follows SpongeBob around his house and into the bathroom in which he jumps into the sink. SpongeBob mistakes the cave sponge for a mirror of himself. SpongeBob goes to a special room in which he gets dressed and Spongy follows. Spongy also gets dressed like SpongeBob by the machine but the shoes do not seem to fit him, which makes him sad. He follows SpongeBob out of his house and into the streets of Bikini Bottom.\nSpongy continues to follow SpongeBob, and attempts to mimic SpongeBob's movements, but causes destruction instead. He then follows SpongeBob into The Krusty Krab's kitchen, then freaks out over the sound of the blender and gets on the hanger with the pots and pans.\nMr. Krabs then calls SpongeBob to go out of the kitchen and into the dining room. Multiple people accuse SpongeBob of breaking their stuff, leading to his arrest. SpongeBob tries to explain that he was framed, but the police do not listen. He then gets taken away to jail. Mr. Krabs says that he is going to visit SpongeBob in jail and leaves Squidward in charge of the cooking.\nSquidward is mad about Mr. Krabs putting him in charge of the grill.

Spongy Spongy then hits Perch Perkins on the head with his club, injuring the reporter.\nThe police officer takes SpongeBob to see Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob taps his shoe out of nervousness, as Spongy Spongy hears it and breaks the fence. SpongeBob talks to his boss and frantically tells him he did not do anything, as Mr. Krabs is not buying his employee's story but wants to help him. He tells SpongeBob to just confess, since nobody else in town looks like him, before Spongy Spongy promptly breaks through the wall and the shocked Mr. Krabs sees that SpongeBob was actually telling the truth and Spongy Spongy was really the culprit of the destruction. The two watch as Spongy Spongy breaks the glass in the room as it lands on Mr. Krabs.

SpongeBob sees all the different kinds of clams, including the soft shell clam, the hard shell clam, the giant clam, and the razor clam. SpongeBob then takes bits of Krabby Patties as bait to lure the clams closer for a better view. Patrick then feels hungry and eats all of the bait with his tongue from the ground. SpongeBob notices and waits for Patrick to fall asleep. After he falls asleep, SpongeBob secretly takes out the bits of Krabby Patties to lure them once again for it to eventually work. Squidward notices and is not too happy with the idea. The clams enter and make a mess of his house. The clams then make a mess on Squidward for shouting at SpongeBob. Squidward, annoyed, takes a bath stating he will never be clean again.\nLater, SpongeBob is on his way to work, but the clams end up following him. SpongeBob tries to get the clams away from him, but they instead follow him some more. So he decides to take them with him. As a result of the clams stealing others' food, SpongeBob takes them to the Krusty Krab. Squidward notices the clams and hollers, fleeing the scene and screaming that he just got clean and that he does not want to be pooped on again. SpongeBob explicitly tells the clams to not steal anyone's food, only for this to result in all of them not listening. Mr. Krabs comes out wondering what is happening and puts him and SpongeBob under the boat.

SpongeBob sadly agrees to do so, and Mr. Krabs still asks for more pearls, only to be crushed a bigger one than before. SpongeBob leads the clams away, and the characters move back to reveal a violinist playing the background music. SpongeBob and the clams journey through the seasons, and eventually part ways when fall starts to arrive. One season later, Squidward just finishes cleaning his house when he mistakes SpongeBob for a clam because he took on a clam-like form. This alarms Squidward and makes him fall in the drool pool caused by Patrick's dribbling during his nap and freaks out. Patrick immediately wakes up and runs around, alarmed, with Squidward.

Wanting to prove that the latter is still healthy, Plankton shows Karen its insides with X-rays, only to see that Spot is pregnant. Karen explains to him that food-rich environments such as the one Plankton provided to Spot causes amoebas to reproduce. Plankton starts panicking, while Spot is generating other amoebas.

{"prompt": "There's a Sponge in My Soup", "completion": "The episode begins on a windy winter day in the Krusty Krab kitchen, where Mr. Krabs has brought SpongeBob some ingredients for the new Krabby Soup. The ingredients include a half-eaten Krabby Patty, two moldy pickles, and some smashed potatoes that look like Squidward. SpongeBob asks him if he got the ingredients from the garbage, but he claims that he intercepted them before they made it to the garbage. Mr. Krabs then starts listing everyone he wants to try the soup and SpongeBob asks about hippies, to which Mr. Krabs angrily repeats \"hippies.\" SpongeBob informs him that there are hippies living out back by the hydrothermal vent. Mr. Krabs goes out to remove the hippies from his property, but they refuse to leave. He accidentally falls into the vent, and the hippies go inside the kitchen where it is warm. The hippies hop into the Krabby soup, while Mr. Krabs seals off the vent. When he returns to the kitchen, he and SpongeBob notice that the soup is just broth. He tells SpongeBob that he can add more ingredients. When SpongeBob throws in some ingredients, they keep getting eaten by the hippies and SpongeBob believes they are disappearing. He puts in an onion that they throw back out at him.\nAt the tables, the hippies keep popping out of the customers' soup. They return the soup to Squidward at the counter, who tries to throw them in the trash but is stopped by Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs then returns the soup to the pot, but is surprised to see the hippies slide in. He orders them to leave, but they refuse. Mr. Krabs tries to fish them out with long hair as bait, but is unsuccessful. He then tries to tempt them with a crochet foot-bag, but they end up kicking it into the pot with them. Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Squidward then form a drum circle that leads the hippies out. However, their hands begin to cramp and they can no longer beat the drums. Mr. Krabs says \"I wish we had another drummer,\" to which SpongeBob pulls out a toy monkey drummer. This causes the hippies to go back to the soup, claiming \"Drum machines aren't cool.\"\nMr. Krabs sends SpongeBob into the soup to remove the hippies. After having a conversation with the hippies, they all begin to meditate and SpongeBob becomes a hippie himself. Mr. Krabs pulls SpongeBob out and realizes he has gone too deep, so he sends him back in. Upon entering the soup again, SpongeBob finds Patrick, who also appears to be a hippie. SpongeBob says everything is getting confusing and goes to have a Krabby Patty to calm himself down.\nBack in the kitchen, SpongeBob realizes the Krusty Krab appears to be different. He exits the kitchen and finds Mr. Krabs meditating. Mr. Krabs tells him that he had to shut down the Krusty Krab since SpongeBob was not there to make the patties. This upsets SpongeBob, so they start dancing to cheer him up. SpongeBob asks him if they can reopen the Krusty Krab, to which Mr. Krabs replies \"I thought you'd never ask.\" In order to get rid of the hippies, they remember that they need to be someplace warm. They send the hippies to Squidward's bathtub, which shocks him when he begins to take a bath. He ends the episode yelling \"hippies!\""}

So SpongeBob and Patrick decide to give him a sand pie to welcome him to Bikini Bottom. When Man Ray opens the door, SpongeBob gives him the pie and they walk in. They sit down and SpongeBob mentions about the Junior Crime Breakers to him. Patrick says he is not giving any snacks for them, so Man Ray gives him the pie, and he returns to the bathroom.

Man Ray finds his weapon, an umbrella. SpongeBob and Patrick stumble down the stairs and confront Man Ray. SpongeBob and Patrick tell him to surrender, but Man Ray tells them he is on Holiday.\nThey still do not believe him, so Patrick throws his broken picture frame at Man Ray. However, Man Ray opens his umbrella, and the picture frame bounces off of it and hits and destroys a huge red vase. SpongeBob then throws the stale cookies at Man Ray, but he runs away from them, as the cookies destroy Squidward's figurines. Man Ray takes cover from the cookies behind the sofa. He then throws the sofa at SpongeBob and Patrick, destroying a part of the house, and causing them to nearly fall out of the house. Patrick then gets spun around by Man Ray and thrown, hitting a glass shelf full of clarinets. SpongeBob then takes three clarinets and snares Man Ray with the clarinets.

SpongeBob then reminds Mr. Krabs of a rule in the Krusty Krab Manual: \"The customer is always right! When they have money.\" Mr. Krabs then thanks SpongeBob for reminding him.\nNext, SpongeBob accidentally spills a drop of ketchup, which makes Mr. Krabs furious. He loses his temper and harshly yells at SpongeBob, calling him a \"Ketchup waster,\" which makes SpongeBob upset. Mr. Krabs apologizes and promises that he will not make any other outbursts. Squidward then drops Bubble Bass' napkin and makes Mr. Krabs even more furious. Mr. Krabs screams again, calling Squidward a \"waster\" and tries to beat him up. He chases Squidward with the register boat until he eventually crashes into Larry. Larry decides to calm Krabs down with a hug.\nMr. Krabs explains to Larry that he was angry because the Krusty Krab has been so busy lately. Larry then suggests that Mr. Krabs should take a vacation. SpongeBob says that he can leave himself and Squidward in charge while he is gone. Mr. Krabs thinks about it, while the scene cuts to a flashback where SpongeBob and Squidward are in charge and the Krusty Krab is all burned down. Mr. Krabs rushes over and tells them that he needs a strong man to take care of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob points to Larry and Mr. Krabs leaves him in charge.\nLater on, SpongeBob is cooking Krabby Patties, when Larry comes in asking why the customers eat their meals like slobs. Larry decides to whip them in shape because he feels bad for them. Squidward is taking Fred's order. Larry puts him on a treadmill. He falls off and Frank comes to take his order. Larry gives a customer Octavius Rex's Krabby Patty order and his side salad on a very strong plate. He takes it to his table and passes out because he is so tired of pushing it.

SpongeBob tries one and spits it out because he does not like it.\nLarry and the strong fish change the name of the Krusty Krab to the Healthy Krab and put gym equipment for the customers to exercise. Larry orders SpongeBob and Squidward to give the customers their protein power shakes. SpongeBob gives one to Nat Peterson, who is on the rock climbing wall. The protein power shake drops on his head and he falls off the rock climbing wall. Squidward tries to give one to Incidental 37B, but he needs to jump over the hurdles. Bubble Bass trips on one of them and falls on him. It soon dawns on Squidward and SpongeBob that Larry has turned the whole restaurant into a Gym. They try to escape by climbing the cargo climbing net, but Squidward gets tangled and stuck on it.\nAfter Squidward's escape plan fails, he gives SpongeBob a plan to sabotage Larry's training sessions. SpongeBob does his plan, but forgets to untangle Squidward. SpongeBob puts butter, lard, and mayonnaise into a mixer and fills it into the protein power shakes. He gives them to Larry and his friends. Instead of drinking them, Larry rubs it on his chest. That plan fails, so Squidward gives him another plan, which is to sabotage the weight machines so they will leave. SpongeBob goes to do his plan, but once again, he forgets to untangle Squidward. SpongeBob sabotages the weight machines. Frank goes over to work out at the weight machine that SpongeBob just destroyed. He tries it and then he eventually gets himself tangled. He breaks out and loves it. SpongeBob goes to Squidward and says that he gives up. He leaves, yet he forgets to untangle Squidward.\nSpongeBob leaves and sees all of the customers waiting outside starving. SpongeBob asks why they are not leaving. Harold says that they will not leave because they need Krabby Patties and they do not have any at home. Because of this, SpongeBob declares war. SpongeBob and the customers get their weapons and walk out of the kitchen. They start the war, and SpongeBob's team is winning by making Larry's team eat Krabby Patties. They get everybody except Larry. Since he is too good at dodging, they have to distract him by getting Bubble Bass to try to lift weights. Larry gets distracted and SpongeBob slingshots a Krabby Patty in his mouth. Larry swallows it and thinks they are so delicious that he and his chest start crying because he could have been making Krabby Patties instead of trying to make people exercise. SpongeBob comforts him, telling him it is just because he wanted them to get in shape. Larry and his friends take their equipment back to his gym, with Squidward still stuck on the cargo climbing net. Mr. Krabs comes home and sees everything is exactly how he left it, as the episode ends."}

Patrick comes by in his knight costume, but he is not amused by SpongeBob's house because it is \"too cute for Halloween.\" SpongeBob shows him his daisy costume, but Patrick is still not impressed because it is not scary enough. Patrick shows SpongeBob what scary is when Squidward's house scared the trick-or-treaters with onions. SpongeBob admits that he loves to go trick-or-treating, but he is too afraid to go out on Halloween. Patrick tells SpongeBob that there is no need to be afraid as long as he believes in one simple statement: Scary equals funny. SpongeBob agrees and goes with him.\nThe first place they stop at is Sandy's treedome. Sandy appears in her mad scientist outfit and is dubbed under the name: Dr. Franken-Cheeks. She, SpongeBob, and Patrick play a guessing game with her jars of horror and she shows them her latest invention: the acorn monster. Afterwards, SpongeBob and Patrick stop over at the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs and Squidward are doing a haunted tour of the Chum Bucket. SpongeBob enjoys the haunted tour and laughs himself out. Mr. Krabs asks why SpongeBob is laughing, but SpongeBob tells him that he has a new theory: Scary equals funny. SpongeBob's theory does not intrigue both Mr. Krabs and Squidward and claim it as a major insult on Halloween. SpongeBob and Patrick stop over at the Chum Bucket, where Plankton and Karen are doing the haunted tour of the Krusty Krab. But SpongeBob finds this funny as well, which deeply annoys Plankton and Karen.\nMeanwhile, in the skies above Bikini Bottom, the Flying Dutchman is enjoying himself on Halloween. However, he is halted by SpongeBob's laughter. He descends downward and goes to ask SpongeBob why is he laughing on Halloween. SpongeBob says that he used to be scared until Patrick told him that scary equals funny. The Flying Dutchman is offended by that statement at first, but when he looks at the Krusty Krab decorations, he concludes that they are as laughable SpongeBob claims they are. He decides to offer them a thrill ride inside his pirate ship, which SpongeBob and Patrick agree.\nSpongeBob and Patrick ride inside the ship, where it is filled with ghosts, ghouls, skeletons, and monsters. Patrick is terrified, but SpongeBob still thinks it is funny. The Flying Dutchman begins to get annoyed with SpongeBob's laughter, but he soon gets another idea. Upon hearing that SpongeBob has other friends, the Flying Dutchman unleashes a ghostly mist that separates the souls of Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Gary, and Plankton from their bodies. SpongeBob and Patrick are still riding in the ship and they encounter the souls of their friends locked in cages as they call for help. SpongeBob still finds this funny as he initially does not think it is really them, until he notices Patrick's soul caged up as well. Patrick confesses that he had been wrong all along and admits that sometimes scary equals scary. After hearing that, and seeing Patrick's soulless body, SpongeBob finally realizes the damage embracing Patrick's theory has done and runs out of the ship in fear. But, despite his fear, he decides to go back and rescue his friends.\nBack on the ship, the Flying Dutchman tortures the souls of SpongeBob's friends. Plankton manages to set himself free and offers the Flying Dutchman a deal: Plankton takes over the world and they will split it 70-30. The Dutchman, however, ignores the offer and instead turns Plankton into his ghoulish servant. Just as the Dutchman prepares to roast the souls of SpongeBob's friends over a pit of demonic blue flames, SpongeBob appears in Sandy's acorn monster puppet. He goes to attack the Dutchman, but he ends up flying into a wall, destroying the puppet in the process. The Dutchman laughs at SpongeBob, as he believes that he is too stupid to scare someone like him. Plankton mentions the scary things SpongeBob has inside his brain, which infuriates the Dutchman to the point of stepping on him. However, he is encouraged to fly inside his brain and have a look.\nInside SpongeBob's brain, the Flying Dutchman encounters various creatures flying around and they carry him everywhere. All the dream creatures succeed in doing is unnerving the Dutchman, and he concludes that SpongeBob does not have any scary thoughts in his brain. But SpongeBob, who regains consciousness, says that what always scared him is when his mother takes out his naked baby pictures. At that moment, a giant naked baby version of SpongeBob appears and hugs the Flying Dutchman. The other dream creatures approach him as well and the Dutchman becomes scared. He flies out of SpongeBob's head and runs away, frightened. As his ship disappears, the souls of SpongeBob's friends return to their bodies. SpongeBob and Patrick agree that they learned to never use shortcuts, such as Patrick's \"Scary equals Funny\" theory, to face their fears again, and everyone runs into the Krusty Krab for the party. Meanwhile, Plankton gets picked up by a trick-or-treater and eats him, mistaking him for a piece of candy, as the episode ends."}

SpongeBob then notices a bunch of construction supplies in the trash behind the Krusty Krab, and makes himself a bed out of wood. However, SpongeBob has difficulties sleeping that night. The next morning, Mr. Krabs approaches an exhausted SpongeBob and claims that he has a workaround for SpongeBob's roof problem. He has Squidward hoist the grill up to the roof so that SpongeBob can still cook even if he cannot get back down. SpongeBob is happy to see his grill, but claims that something is still missing. SpongeBob decides to build himself an entire kitchen on the roof using the tools he found the previous night. Later that day, SpongeBob has Krabby Patties prepared, but cannot serve them due to being stuck up on the roof.\nHe then gets the idea to use napkins to parachute the Krabby Patties down to the customers, but the customers complain that the Krabby Patties are cold, and think that if they go up onto the roof, they will get the Krabby Patties fresh. In the next scene, we see that SpongeBob has built an entire dining room on top of the roof, much to Mr. Krabs' delight. Squidward is shown to be inside the Krusty Krab, and has decorated it to his liking, happy that he will not have to be bothered by anyone. Suddenly, rainclouds form in the sky, and a thunder storm reigns terror on the customers. Many people are blown off of the roof, including Patrick, who faceplants again. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob to do something, and SpongeBob builds another Krusty Krab on top of the old one. However, the customers are now bored from being inside and are about to leave, but SpongeBob stops them. He starts playing the same music that he played in the beginning of the episode, and everyone, including Mr. Krabs, starts dancing to it. Outside, we see that the rain is causing the ground to become muddy, sinking the bottom Krusty Krab underground, and sinking the top Krusty Krab to ground level.

SpongeBob passes out from exhaustion and drops his mop on Squidward's face, waking him up. Mr. Krabs questions why Plankton has not shown up yet, and thinks that the door is stuck.

He sees the cup turn into Plankton, and suddenly, red and green demon Planktons start appearing everywhere. Mr. Krabs tries to escape, but ends up running into a giant demonic Plankton with devil horns. Mr. Krabs screams and runs into the bathroom, splashing water on his face to try and reclaim his sanity.

They were really running away from a waterfall from behind the two playmates, and the latter fall down the waterfall.\nJust after, Bubble Bass wakes up as Patrick performs CPR on Bubble Bass, claiming that he was \"dead\" for ten minutes. The whole thing ended up being a hallucination. Patrick's confidence about the indoor pool, and a slap in the back, release the Wonder Whale action figure from inside Bubble Bass.

Back at the Chum Bucket, the glove is replaced by a combat boot, which Plankton considers better than a glove. However, it falls through the Chum Bucket and crushes Plankton as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Breakin'", "completion": "At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is cooking Krabby Patties when Mr. Krabs and a labor authority officer come in. Mr. Krabs explains that SpongeBob must take a five-minute break or else he will get fined. SpongeBob sees dirt on a table and cleans it up, and Mr. Krabs tells him that he cannot work on his break. The labor authority author starts to fine Mr. Krabs, so he uncovers an employee break room.\nSpongeBob is excited about the break room and makes a carousel out of hot dogs, then puts it in the microwave. He surfs on a chair in front of a wave poster and then eats expired leftovers from the fridge. SpongeBob then makes a band out of various objects and starts playing music, which attracts the customers into the break room.\nMr. Krabs notices that the Krusty Krab is empty and finds everyone dancing in the break room, including the labor authority officer. He interrupts it to tell SpongeBob that his break is over. The officer agrees to not fine Mr. Krabs, and SpongeBob is excited for his next break in 20 years.\nMr. Krabs covers up the break room and SpongeBob goes back to the kitchen, but notices Squidward missing. It is then revealed that Squidward is taking a break in the break room as well."}
{"prompt": "Boss for a Day", "completion": "The episode begins on a particularly busy day at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is managing everything smoothly, while barking orders at SpongeBob and Squidward. Mr. Krabs helps out the customers with their problems, whether it be refilling a man's drink, giving another customer ketchup, or a slicing a Krabby Patty into small pieces for a little baby to eat. Mr. Krabs also manages to fight off a group of pirates at the same time all of this is happening. After all of that, Mr. Krabs' claw smells cash, and finds a penny on the floor. Mr. Krabs delightfully claims the penny, but almost immediately afterwards, SpongeBob kicks open the kitchen door, accidentally knocking Mr. Krabs all over the restaurant until he eventually lands in the middle of the street. A construction worker hoisting up a piano becomes distracted when he notices the penny that Mr. Krabs found earlier fell out of his pocket, causing Mr. Krabs to be crushed by the piano. An ambulance arrives immediately, but before they take Mr. Krabs away, SpongeBob asks who will be in charge of the Krusty Krab while he is out. Mr. Krabs is about to point at Squidward, but he puts SpongeBob in front of him, officially making SpongeBob the boss of the Krusty Krab until Mr. Krabs recovers, much to Mr. Krabs' dismay. Squidward mocks SpongeBob, saying that he will probably ruin everything \"like he always does.\" SpongeBob decides that if he wants to boss like Mr. Krabs, he will have to act like him too.\nLater on, a nurse is wheeling Mr. Krabs, who is in a full body cast, back to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob greets him at the front door, and wheels him inside of the restaurant to show him how he has been taking care of things. He reveals that he hired Patrick to be the new fry cook of the Krusty Krab, since he is too busy being the boss now, much to Mr. Krabs' distress. SpongeBob shows Mr. Krabs how much of an effective boss he is by helping two troubled customers; one of which needs a napkin, and the other having a wobbly table. Nearby, Squidward yells at a customer, which results in SpongeBob scolding him. SpongeBob makes Squidward wear a helmet that forces him to smile to appear more friendly to the customer, but it only creeps him out instead. Squidward is about to blow up at SpongeBob, but they suddenly hear a slicing sound coming from the kitchen, and SpongeBob goes to check it out. It is Patrick, attempting to clean the deli-slicer with a pair of tongs. SpongeBob offers to take care of the situation, while Patrick gets back to work. In the next scene, Patrick is trying to make a Krabby Patty, but SpongeBob micromanages everything he does, even down to the tiniest detail. This annoys Patrick to the point where he quits, but not before taking off all of his clothes. Patrick slams the door on his way out, and SpongeBob gets caught in the spinning door, resulting in a part of himself being sliced off. SpongeBob ends up leaving the SpongeBob slice clone in charge of the cooking. Out in the dining room, Squidward is being pestered by an angry mob. This prompts him to storm out of the restaurant, but not before SpongeBob attempts to stop him. It does not work however, as Squidward screams in SpongeBob's face that he quits for good, angrily leaving the Krusty Krab.\nThe angry mob turns to SpongeBob, but he quickly thinks of the solution to slice off another clone of himself and put him in charge of the cash register. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that everything is now under control, but out of nowhere, tons of things start going wrong at once. One woman spills her drink, another man slips in the spill and falls, one customer complains that the TV does not work, one customer complains that it is too hot, and another customer complains that it is too cold. The pressure eventually gets to SpongeBob, as he screams at the tops of his lungs for everyone to stop. SpongeBob runs back into the kitchen and starts slicing off multiple clones of himself, all of which assist each and every customer with their problems. Suddenly, Patrick (who is still naked) bursts through the front door, saying that he is just \"cleaning out his desk\" (although in actuality, he just steals a family's meal). Patrick leaves the door open though, resulting in the SpongeBob slice clones being blown around the restaurant and eventually being sliced to bits via the Krusty Krab's ceiling fan. All of the customers are grossed out by the sponge bits and leave the establishment, making Mr. Krabs furious to the point where he breaks out of his body cast. SpongeBob (who is now stuck in the ceiling fan) apologizes to Mr. Krabs for messing everything up. Mr. Krabs forgives him, saying that the rage he felt watching him destroy his restaurant forced his body to heal very quickly, but also states that SpongeBob's pay will have to be docked for decades to cover all the damage SpongeBob caused. Mr. Krabs turns on the ceiling fan and laughs, while SpongeBob spins around in the ceiling fan, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "The Goofy Newbie", "completion": "The episode opens with Patrick at Goofy Goobers, sampling ice cream. The cashier gets annoyed and calls security to kick him out. Outside, Patrick sees two of the workers at Goofy Goobers receiving ice cream on their break, prompting him to apply for the job.\nThe manager of the place shows Patrick the history of Goofy Goobers, as well as what he needs to do to be a good employee. He first tasks Patrick to clean the dishes. After they are all cleaned, the manager asks him how he cleaned them. Patrick says he cleaned them using his saliva, disgusting the manager.\nThe manager gives Patrick his next job, which is to unload ice cream boxes from a truck into the freezer. Patrick attempts to do this, but since he feels cold in there, he turns the heat on, which causes a flood and annoys the manager.\nAfterwards, the manager tasks Patrick to go into the Goofy Goober mascot costume to entertain the kids. While inside it, Patrick sees that there is unattended ice cream, and decides to suck it all into his costume. The manager finds out about this and tells Patrick if he fails at the job the next day, he will fire him. Patrick comes back home and tells SpongeBob, who was sitting on his rock house, about his day. SpongeBob tells Patrick he will help him out at work so Patrick does not get fired.\nSpongeBob hides inside of Patrick's uniform and starts working at the place efficiently. The manager is impressed with Patrick and finally gives him a break, allowing him to get the free ice cream he wanted. Patrick wanted to share the ice cream with SpongeBob, but the latter is almost late for the Krusty Krab, so Patrick is all on his own eating. However, Patrick realizes his break is almost over, so he tries to eat all the ice cream he can. However, he eats so much ice cream that he gets a brain freeze, causing the Earth to freeze for five billion years. When it becomes unfrozen, the manager fires Patrick. Since he was lactose intolerant anyways, the episode ends with him walking out the restaurant into a UFO happily."}
{"prompt": "The Ghost of Plankton", "completion": "The episode starts with Plankton watching a horror movie on Karen's screen on movie night. When he pretends to be a ghost, he gets an idea to steal the secret formula. After Karen unplugs herself, Plankton creates a ghost extracting machine, and turns into a ghost. By being a ghost, he can go through walls, which is how he got into the safe in the Krusty Krab. However, by being a ghost, he can go through walls, but he cannot pick things up either, leading to what seems to be a failure.\nThat is when the Flying Dutchman appears on Mr. Krabs' chair, cackling, and tells Plankton that it takes some training to pick things up, and he picks up the bottle on his first try. So the training begins.\nFirst off, the Flying Dutchman tells Plankton that he needs to learn the art of shapeshifting, in which one should think of a scary thought, and then they become that scary thought. The Flying Dutchman turns into multiple scary things, and then it is Plankton's turn. He turns into a weird shape, but since it is not scary, he becomes a duplicate of the Flying Dutchman. Accepting the pupil's talent, the Flying Dutchman whacks him with a mallet. They move on to lesson two.\nIn order to be a proper ghost, one has to scare others. The Flying Dutchman scares the life out of a thief, and when Plankton does his scare, he accidentally scares himself through a mirror. The Flying Dutchman accepts it, hits him with a golf club, and they move on to lesson three.\nFor this lesson, one has to make another's life a nightmare by haunting their house. The Flying Dutchman and Plankton go over to Squidward's house, and the haunting begins. Plankton becomes Squidward's bed and shakes, waking Squidward up. When he finds out his bed is haunted, Squidward hides in the dresser, with his clarinet. But he plays his clarinet badly, and a few seconds later, an annoyed Plankton pulls the clarinet from Squidward and morphs into a SpongeBob ghost, and becomes visible. Squidward tries to escape, but knocks himself unconscious. Plankton, realizing he took the clarinet, finds out that he can pick things up now. They move onto the final lesson.\nIn this final lesson, the Flying Dutchman tells Plankton that he has to be really angry in order to pick something up. On a second attempt to steal the formula, Plankton picks it up just fine after hearing the Dutchman's advice. However, when he tries to take it out of the safe, the bottle will not go through the wall, as it is not a ghost. After admitting defeat, he decides to go back to his regular body.\nBut when he enters the Chum Bucket, he is surprised to find out that Karen had invited everyone to Plankton's funeral because he left his body alone for too long. His corpse lay on a coffin, and Plankton feels like getting into his body when the Flying Dutchman says he is dead forever. Plankton denies it, saying he is only a \"temporary\" ghost, but an eager Flying Dutchman goes into Plankton's body to be alive again. Believing that Plankton played a cruel joke by pretending to be dead, all the mourners, except SpongeBob, get real angry. They form a mob and stomp on the Flying Dutchman in Plankton's body. He decides to give up and give Plankton his body back stating that the Flying Dutchman would rather be dead than alive. Plankton happily accepts, and even after being stomped multiple times by the people, he says that it is good to be alive. To end the episode, the Flying Dutchman does a jump scare in front of a \"The End\" card."}
{"prompt": "My Two Krabses", "completion": "In the beginning of the episode, Mr. Krabs goes into a tanning booth in his room as part of him getting ready for his date with Mrs. Puff. While SpongeBob is serving a Krabby Patty to Patrick, he hears Mr. Krabs saying it is hot in his office. Thinking that he is in trouble, he goes inside, only to see Mr. Krabs' shell empty and melted ice cream sandwich, which he thinks is blood, all over him.\nSpongeBob gets sad, fearing Mr. Krabs has died from exsanguination, but when Squidward hears about this, he is happy. When he tells them Mr. Krabs had a date, SpongeBob gets the idea to fill the shell with chum so he can still go to the date. He, as well as Patrick, go to his house after buying chum from Plankton, and fill the shell with the chum as organs.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Krabs gets out of the tanning booth, only to realize his shell is gone. He tries to go to his house without being seen to get clothes, but upon reaching there, Pearl and her friends see him naked. At the same time, SpongeBob and Patrick have taught Chum Krabs everything he needs to know for the date. They send him to Mrs. Puff's house to bring her to Fancy!, right before the real Mr. Krabs arrives to do the same thing.\nWhile Mrs. Puff and Chum Krabs are on a date, Mr. Krabs goes to Fancy! so he can have the date. Upon seeing Chum Krabs with his date, he gets angry and tries to stop the imposter. SpongeBob and Patrick throw Mr. Krabs out of Fancy!, only for Squidward to come and tell the two the Mr. Krabs they threw out was the real one. Next, Chum Krabs has a fight with Mr. Krabs after getting out of the restaurant with Mrs. Puff.\nAfter Mr. Krabs wins the fight, he and Mrs. Puff get back together, while SpongeBob and Patrick get taken by the remains of Chum Krabs, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Knock Knock, Who's There?", "completion": "The episode begins at Mr. Krabs and Pearl's house, where Mr. Krabs is shown instructing SpongeBob on what to do while house sitting for him, since Mr. Krabs will be at a fast food convention all night. He tells SpongeBob to lock the windows, always keep a weapon on his person and to not step foot into his bedroom. Mr. Krabs hands SpongeBob a baseball bat, but SpongeBob accidentally hits himself with it, making Mr. Krabs throw the bat away. Mr. Krabs further explains that Pearl is staying with friends, and that SpongeBob will be all alone. He then warns that the neighborhood has seen a spike in robberies recently, and orders SpongeBob to not answer the door for anyone. As Mr. Krabs leaves, he tests this by knocking on his own door as SpongeBob answers, but SpongeBob realizes his mistake and slams the door in Mr. Krabs' face, much to Krabs' satisfaction. In the next scene, SpongeBob is seen checking around the house, making sure there are no robbers about. He then notices Mr. Krabs' bedroom, and suspects that burglars might be hiding, but remembers that he is not allowed to set foot in there. To get around this, SpongeBob ties a balloon to his nose. While searching through Mr. Krabs' bedroom, SpongeBob finds money under his pillow, a music box with a Mrs. Puff figurine, a bottle of cologne called \"Midnight Pincer,\" and a knot collection. SpongeBob suddenly hears a doorbell, and assumes it's the pizza that he ordered earlier. SpongeBob tells the delivery boy to slide the pizza into the mail slot, since he isn't allowed to open the door.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Krabs arrives at the Bikini Bottom Convention Hall for the Fast Food Founding Fathers (or F.F.F.F.) convention. The doorman asks Mr. Krabs to pay 10 cents as an entrance fee, but Mr. Krabs thinks 10 cents is a ripoff and decides to go home. As Mr. Krabs is taking off, he overhears another fish winning 1,000 dollars for being the 100th person to enter the building, much to his shock. Back at Mr. Krabs' house, SpongeBob is seen watching TV, but when a horror movie comes on, he turns off the TV in fright. Just then, a knock is heard at the door, and SpongeBob approaches cautiously. It is Mr. Krabs, who cannot enter his house because he forgot his keys. SpongeBob does not believe him, however, as he thinks that Mr. Krabs is still at his convention. SpongeBob admits that the \"robber\" sounds like Mr. Krabs, but looks nothing like him (due to the door's peephole distorting Mr. Krabs' appearance thus making him look different). Mr. Krabs attempts to get in through the mail slot, but fails due to him being too big. He then notices that the top window is open, and starts climbing on the side of his house in order to reach it. In a frenzy, SpongeBob calls Patrick on the phone and asks him to come over to Krabs' house, due to thinking the \"burglar\" is trying to break in. Patrick arrives shortly, and is able to enter the house via the mail slot, due to him having no bones and being completely made out of blubber. At the same time, Mr. Krabs is able to approach his window, but is struck down by lightning. SpongeBob and Patrick decide to start setting up traps for the robber.\nIn the next scene, we see that Mr. Krabs' house is filled with booby traps, such as pillows being hung from the ceiling, and a bucket of warm water being set under the window. They hear glass breaking, and prepare all the traps for use. Mr. Krabs tries to break in through the window, but is sprayed in the eyes by his own perfume, and lands in a puddle of mud. Afterwards, Mr. Krabs tries to enter his house via the toilet (while still covered in mud), but SpongeBob is able to intercept him and flush him back down the toilet using a plunger. Once again, Mr. Krabs tries breaking in, this time through his pet door, but is nearly sliced up by \"sharp\" cheddar. SpongeBob and Patrick celebrate their victory over the robber by watching a tough guy action movie on TV. At the same time, though, Mr. Krabs has had enough and decides to use a giant wrecking ball to break into his own house, and SpongeBob and Patrick are unaware of this due to the sound effects in the movie. Mr. Krabs finally manages to break in, but is trapped inside of a laundry basket held down by a cinderblock. At this point, Mr. Krabs gives up and starts crying, handing SpongeBob and Patrick his ID card to prove he's the real Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob and Patrick realize their mistake and let Mr. Krabs out of the trap. Mr. Krabs isn't mad at them, however, due to SpongeBob actually following his orders. After the trio exchange a hug, they hear more knocking at the door. It's Pearl, who also forgot her keys, but Mr. Krabs doesn't believe her (due to, once again, the door's peephole distorting Pearl's appearance). SpongeBob and Patrick are prepared to set up more traps, and Pearl is seen still banging on the front door, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Pat Hearts Squid", "completion": "The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick playing in the mud outside of Squidward's house while making loud noises. Squidward leans out of his window and screams for the duo to be quiet, threatening to call the cops on them. SpongeBob and Patrick are unable to hear the threat, so Squidward leans out of his window even harder to yell even louder. However, this causes Squidward's house to tip over and collapse, destroying the house. Squidward is saddened that his house is destroyed, so SpongeBob and Patrick offer Squidward to stay at one of their houses, but he refuses. Later that night, Squidward is seen roughing it in a tent where his house used to be, but a sudden rainstorm blows his tent away, leaving him without a shelter. Squidward finally gives in and flips a coin, making him decide to stay at Patrick's house. When Squidward approaches Patrick's house, he is dragged inside by Patrick, and is threatened by a banana Patrick is holding. Squidward identifies himself, and tells Patrick that he will be staying at his place, which thrills the latter. Patrick gives Squidward a bedroom to sleep in, but since everything in Patrick's house is made out of sand, Squidward sleeps without a pillow or blanket. However, he is unable to sleep due to Patrick drooling on his face, and when Squidward yells at him to stop, Patrick wakes up and falls on Squidward, due to thinking there are sand mites in the house.\nThe next morning, Patrick wakes up to find that Squidward has decorated the house to his liking, and is cooking up breakfast in the kitchen. Squidward offers Patrick a lard cake, and as Patrick is about to gobble it down in one bite, Squidward stops him and shows him how to eat like a gentleman. Patrick copies Squidward's habits, making Squidward realize that he can shape Patrick to act like a \"cultured sophisticate.\" A montage commences of Squidward and Patrick spending time together with various activities, including gardening, pedicures, playing clarinet, and dancing. During the montage, Patrick starts to adopt Squidward's looks, from growing two extra legs, morphing his face to look like Squidward's, and wearing a shirt instead of pants. In the next scene, Squidward and Patrick are seen opening up an attraction together called the \"Classy Kiosk,\" gathering a crowd. The duo start painting pictures, but the crowd only seems to like Patrick's pictures, buying all of them out. Squidward tries dancing to entertain the audience, but this only ends with Squidward getting hit with tomatoes. Patrick then also dances for the crowd, who end up loving it. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs go up onstage to congratulate Patrick, and Mr. Krabs comments that Patrick makes a better Squidward than Squidward does. Patrick suddenly starts adapting Squidward's mannerisms and speech patterns, making Squidward very upset, while entertaining the public at the same time.\nMr. Krabs declares Patrick to be the best Squidward, as him and the crowd of people carry Patrick off. Squidward is enraged by this, claiming Patrick to be an imposter of himself. SpongeBob suggests that if Patrick makes a better Squidward, maybe Squidward will make a better Patrick. Squidward loves the idea, and thanks SpongeBob as he runs off. The next morning, Patrick (who is still acting like Squidward), wakes up to find his house to be a total mess. The cause of this is none other than Squidward (who is now purposefully acting like Patrick). Squidward does many dumb things, from slamming a brick into his face, to shoving Patrick's art up his nose, to eating Patrick's clarinet, all of which annoy and frustrate Patrick. Squidward decides to go outside and play with SpongeBob, while Patrick plans to take a nap. Unfortunately for him, he is woken up by the sound of SpongeBob and Squidward's laughing, as both of them are playing in the mud. As Patrick goes outside to yell at them, Squidward throws a handful of mud into Patrick's mouth, making Patrick remember who he used to be. Patrick changes back to normal and joins the two in the mud puddle. Just then, a helicopter is seen delivering Squidward's new house, much to the thrill of the trio. Unfortunately, Squidward's house tips over again and lands on Patrick's house, destroying both homes. In the next scene, Squidward and Patrick are both seen sleeping with SpongeBob in his bed. Squidward cries while turning off the lights, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Lighthouse Louie", "completion": "The episode begins with SpongeBob taking his boating test yet again at Mrs. Puff's Boating School. SpongeBob attempts to read while driving, but does not notice that they are about to crash into a brick wall. SpongeBob takes a sharp turn to avoid the brick wall, but starts driving towards Mrs. Puff's lighthouse. SpongeBob is able to brake in time to avoid crashing into the lighthouse, but a wave of junk from inside the lighthouse ends up spilling onto them anyway. SpongeBob pulls Mrs. Puff out of the rubble, and tries to make up for the damage he caused, but nothing pleases her. Mrs. Puff exclaims that SpongeBob should clean up her lighthouse, since she has been tossing old junk in there for 20 years. She leaves SpongeBob to the task, and heads back into her classroom to listen to heavy metal music. SpongeBob heads into the lighthouse, and cleans it fairly quickly by eating all of the assorted objects and spitting them back out into boxes. He then notices that the lighthouse is extremely dusty, so he cleans the place up using a mop. As SpongeBob is about to head into the next room to shine the lighthouse's lantern, he hears moaning on the other side of the door. \nHe assumes the lighthouse is haunted, just like his toaster. After a cutaway reveals SpongeBob's toaster really is haunted, SpongeBob slowly opens the door. Suddenly, a box drops from the ceiling, scaring SpongeBob into stumbling down the stairs, and onto a box, causing all the trash that SpongeBob just cleaned up to flood everywhere. SpongeBob is terrified as the box slowly approaches him, only to be relieved when it is revealed that a stray snail was inside. SpongeBob decides to name the snail \"Louie\" as he gets back to work cleaning. However, when SpongeBob tries to continue cleaning, he trips over Louie, prompting SpongeBob to leave Louie outside so he does not get in the way. Although when SpongeBob goes back inside, Louie is also somehow back inside, so SpongeBob decides to tie Louie to a nearby boat so he will be out of his hair. Once again though, Louie is somehow back inside the lighthouse, so SpongeBob attempts to throw him out, only to be thrown out himself. SpongeBob refuses to be outsmarted by a snail, and in the next scene, we see SpongeBob trying to trap Louie in a box by using a can of Krabby Patties as bait. However, SpongeBob is outsmarted yet again, as Louie traps him inside of a box. When SpongeBob is unable to lift up the box himself, he eats some Krabby Patty grease (in a reference to Popeye the Sailor Man) to grow buff and lift the box off of him. Soon after, SpongeBob finds Louie in the room with the lighthouse's lantern, but Louie suddenly becomes feral and attacks SpongeBob, biting him all over his face. In the scuffle, SpongeBob accidentally turns on the lighthouse's light switch, shining a very bright light into Bikini Bottom. Bubble Bass, Larry the Lobster, and a third fish notice the light, as SpongeBob and Louie's shadows are being cast onto it. Larry thinks that they are a couple of buff dudes, while Bubble Bass thinks they are giant monsters, causing the trio to panic.\nThe ruckus eventually causes the lighthouse to tip over and start rolling around Bikini Bottom (unbeknownst to Mrs. Puff, who is still listening to her heavy metal music). Larry and the other fish run away, but Bubble Bass ends up getting flattened by the lighthouse. Afterwards, Perch Perkins is seen interviewing Fred on the news, as Fred frantically explains that a lighthouse caused all the destruction. Perch Perkins asks Fred if the lighthouse injured \"HIS LEGS,\" to which Fred sadly replies no. Mr. Krabs sees this on the news, and tells all of his customers to protect the Krusty Krab. They all run away however, and SpongeBob, not wanting to destroy the Krusty Krab, turns the lighthouse around with his feet. Although, when Louie attacks him again, the lighthouse turns back around and ends up destroying the Krusty Krab anyway, injuring Mr. Krabs in the process. The lighthouse ends up rolling back to Mrs. Puff's boating school and is thrown back into its original position. After the chaos, SpongeBob frantically wonders where Louie is, only to find out that Louie was actually a mother taking care of her babies. SpongeBob comments on how he should start calling her \"Louise\" instead. In the next scene, SpongeBob shows Mrs. Puff the clean lighthouse, to which Mrs. Puff exclaims how proud she is of SpongeBob, giving him a gold star. SpongeBob then shows Mrs. Puff \"Louise\" and her babies, telling her how they were hiding inside the lighthouse. Mrs. Puff finds the snails adorable. SpongeBob leaves boating school for the day, as Mrs. Puff is relieved that SpongeBob did not create a huge disaster. Just then, she is confronted by several Bikini Bottomites, including Mr. Krabs, Bubble Bass, and Larry the Lobster. They are furious that Mrs. Puff's lighthouse has caused so much damage in town, and demand to know what she is going to do about it. In response, Mrs. Puff puts on her headphones and (along with Louise and her babies) start jamming out to her heavy metal music, as the episode ends."}
{"prompt": "Hiccup Plague", "completion": "The episode begins with two kids named Timmy and Tina in a treehouse, attempting to get the hiccups. At first, Timmy takes out a can of Fizz Bomb soda, drinks it, and then burps, but that does not work. In the second attempt, they eat a bag of spicy kelp chips, which causes their mouths to burn and then hiccup. In the process, they let out hiccup bubbles. Two of their hiccup bubbles touching each other combines into one bigger bubble and Tina gets the jar to put the bubble in. They trap the hiccup bubble in a jar, and laugh about how this will make a great prank. They release the hiccup bubble into Bikini Bottom, which is about to land on an old woman, but she unknowingly blows it away while blowing her nose. The hiccup bubble then lands on SpongeBob while he is skipping down the street, causing him to get the hiccups.\nLater, at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is about to prepare a fresh batch of Krabby Patties, but his hiccups interfere. At first, SpongeBob uses this to his advantage, using his hiccups to bounce the Krabby Patties off of his head, but this quickly spirals out of control. Mr. Krabs walks into the kitchen to see what is going on, to which he realizes SpongeBob has a case of the hiccups. He attempts to scare the hiccups out of him, but this proves unsuccessful. Mr. Krabs sends SpongeBob home for the day, but not before SpongeBob hiccups the bubble out of his mouth and onto Mr. Krabs, passing the hiccups onto him. Mr. Krabs walks back into the restaurant to greet Mrs. Puff, who is waiting in line, but Mr. Krabs' hiccups prove to be an annoyance. Mrs. Puff claims the hiccups are not contagious and kisses Mr. Krabs on the cheek, and Mr. Krabs unknowingly passes the hiccups onto her. Mrs. Puff then rushes into the restroom and tries drinking water upside down to get rid of the hiccups. Pearl then also walks into the restroom and is confused by what Mrs. Puff is doing. Mrs. Puff then accidentally spits water all over Pearl's pom-poms, making her upset. Mrs. Puff tries to apologize to Pearl, but ends up passing the hiccups to her, causing Pearl to storm out of the restaurant. Pearl attempts to practice cheerleading, but her hiccups get in the way. She ends up passing the hiccups to a group of jellyfish, and she happily finishes her cheer.\nThe Jellyfish then fly past the comic book store where Bubble Bass is reading a comic book, and pass the hiccups onto him. His hiccups cause him to sneeze on his comic book, making him upset. Old Man Jenkins then approaches Bubble Bass and mocks him, saying how back in his day, hiccups could turn someone inside out. This also happens to Bubble Bass, who panics and runs away. We then cut to Perch Perkins, who is reporting the Hiccup Plague on the news, but he just laughs it off until Bubble Bass (still inside out) grabs Perch Perkins' microphone, claiming the Hiccup Plague to be real. He then hiccups, causing the hiccup bubble to travel inside the microphone, and into telephone wires leading to the Chum Bucket, causing Karen to get the hiccups, who then passes the hiccups to Plankton. The hiccups cause Plankton to accidentally drop a couple of beakers he was using, which creates an explosion that sends him flying. He then lands on the ground right in front of Patrick, who ends up accidentally stepping on him. He then picks up Plankton, who ends up passing the hiccups onto him. Plankton laughs in his face and then runs away. Patrick then starts hiccupping, causing him to panic, and he bumps into Squidward. Patrick begs Squidward to help him get rid of the hiccups, but then passes the hiccups onto him. Squidward berates Patrick, saying that hiccups are not contagious, but when he starts hiccupping himself, he panics and takes off.\nWe then see Mrs. Puff, Pearl, and Bubble Bass, who are walking down the street together. Squidward then approaches them and starts uncontrollably hiccupping. This causes them to panic and flee. Squidward is then approached by SpongeBob, who states that he will willingly take the hiccups if Squidward hugs him. He begrudgingly does so, and passes the hiccups onto SpongeBob. Squidward then retreats gleefully, while SpongeBob says goodbye to Bikini Bottom, while Timmy and Tina (the two kids from earlier) are seen giggling behind a mailbox. SpongeBob is then seen sitting on a large piece of coral while sipping on a carton of grape juice. SpongeBob then hiccups, causing him to fall off the coral, and lands in Sandy's arms. SpongeBob is alarmed and tells Sandy to stay away from him as he still has the hiccups. Sandy states that she wants to attempt to cure SpongeBob of the hiccups and take him back to her treedome.\nAt Sandy's Treedome, SpongeBob is seen in a small tank, while Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, Pearl, Bubble Bass, Patrick, and Squidward look on. Mr. Krabs once again tries to scare the hiccups out of SpongeBob, but fails. Mrs. Puff suggests drinking water upside down, Pearl suggests to do a cheer, Bubble Bass suggests hiding pickles under his tongue, Patrick suggests eating Snail-Po, and Squidward suggests nothing. SpongeBob tries all of these options, but none of them end up working. Sandy tries to treat the situation \"scientifically\" and tickles SpongeBob, which actually ends up working. The hiccup bubble floats out of the Treedome as everyone cheers. The hiccup bubble then floats back to the treehouse where Tina and Timmy are laughing, but the hiccups are passed onto them.

SpongeBob sees that Mr. Krabs is eating chum and likes it, but he does not understand why. Mr. Krabs tells a story about how during one of his navy days, he barely made it back to his ship alive only to find it robbed of all their supplies (although in actuality, he had slept through the entire day while his crew ate everything) and was forced to eat chum due to being the only food left, and upon eating it, grew to love it.\nSpongeBob promises to keep this a secret, and afterwards, the Slop Pail closes as the owner of the restaurant, Sal, wants to become a movie star. This leaves Mr. Krabs with no chum to eat that is not from the Chum Bucket. Back at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob makes several types of chum with different ingredients as he is unable to make the actual chum recipe. However, Mr. Krabs says none of them are right.\nMr. Krabs tries to prevent himself from going to the Chum Bucket, but ends up searching for chum there anyway.

SpongeBob tries to evade this by keeping the foot with the ankle alarm outside the enclosures, but this fails and he gets kicked out of the zoo, with Patrick sneaking into a sea monkey enclosure so he gets kicked out with him.\nSpongeBob is crying on Patrick's rock, until he gets the idea of building a bubble zoo after creating a snot bubble.

Meanwhile, Patrick is taking a long time to order something, much to Squidward's annoyance. SpongeBob says \"hi\" to Mrs. Puff, but Mrs. Puff reminds him that they should pretend not to know each other when they are not at school. SpongeBob delivers two Krabby Patties to Mrs. Puff and Pearl by spitting them out of his eyes. Out of nowhere, the local health inspector appears and declares the Krusty Krab to be a health hazard. He suspects that someone in the restaurant has a case of the \"Clam Flu\" and puts the restaurant under quarantine, locking everyone inside. This causes everyone except for SpongeBob to run around, screaming and panicking. Patrick then asks what a quarantine actually is, and SpongeBob replies that it is like a \"mandatory sleepover.\" Squidward debunks this, saying that a quarantine eventually makes everyone sick. Plankton comes out of a nearby soda cup, saying that he is abandoning \"operation soda-jerk.\" He escapes via the restaurant's funnel, but is immediately vaporized by a hazmat fish, prompting everyone to stay inside.\nPearl complains, but Mr. Krabs states that back in his navy days, they would isolate the \"sicko\" and lock them in the freezer so that the others can enjoy their good health. Mrs. Puff asks if they let the sicko out of the freezer once he got better. Mr. Krabs says that they probably let him out eventually, which concerns Mrs. Puff. Mr. Krabs asks if anyone is feeling sick, to which nobody responds, prompting him to use a pair of tongs as a threat. This causes Squidward to freak out and bump into a table, launching pepper in the air and into SpongeBob's nose, causing him to sneeze. Everyone assumes that SpongeBob has the disease, even though he does not. SpongeBob states that he will go into the freezer willingly, despite not feeling sick. He tries to have an emotional speech, but he is cut short when Mr. Krabs slams the door in his face. It is then revealed that SpongeBob is having fun in the freezer, sledding on a mountain of snow and eating ice cream. Everyone is relieved as they think the worst of the quarantine is over. Patrick looks over and notices that SpongeBob has an ice cream cone, making him interested. Patrick pretends to be sick by rubbing relish all over himself. This causes everyone to freak out, and Patrick ends up getting locked in the freezer. SpongeBob and Patrick end up having a snowball fight with ice cream.\nMr. Krabs, Squidward, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl are sitting at a table, paranoid if anyone else has the disease. Squidward itches his arm, and Pearl accuses him of having the Clam Flu. Mr. Krabs throws Squidward in the freezer. Mrs. Puff then yawns, making Mr. Krabs freak out, and he locks her in the freezer as well. Pearl remembers that she still had money leftover from last time she went to the mall. This makes Mr. Krabs think that the flu has poisoned Pearl's mind, and he locks her in the freezer too. In the freezer, everyone is meeting up inside of an igloo, and Squidward finds out that nobody there is actually sick, making Mrs. Puff deduce that Mr. Krabs is the one with the sickness. This makes Pearl cry. Squidward decides that the only option is to break out of the freezer and lock Mr. Krabs inside. Everyone agrees, except for SpongeBob, who is reluctant at first. Squidward convinces him by explaining that he cannot make Krabby Patties if he is locked in the freezer.\nEveryone busts out of the freezer, much to Mr. Krabs' surprise. Patrick tries to attack him, but Krabs shrinks himself down and hides under the grill. SpongeBob chases Mr. Krabs under the grill and tries to convince him to go willingly, but Mr. Krabs refuses and goes down a pipe leading to the grease trap. SpongeBob comes out from under the grill, covered in mold and unaware of what to do. Patrick lifts up the grill and shoves Squidward through the pipe, covering him in grease. After seeing Squidward, Mr. Krabs escapes the grease trap and runs into the dining room. Pearl gives chase, but Mr. Krabs gets stuck in her blowhole. Pearl sneezes him out, but he loses his shirt in the processes, causing her blowhole to get plugged up. Patrick corners Mr. Krabs, and they begin to fight. During the fight, Mr. Krabs throws Patrick into the broom closet, covering him in dust. Patrick grabs Mr. Krabs with his tongue and throws him to Mrs. Puff, who catches him in a garbage can. She puffs up, causing trash to fall all over her. Later that night, the health inspector returns to the Krusty Krab. He says that he made a mistake (it is surprisingly revealed that it's because he had been holding his tracking equipment upside-down the whole time) and nobody is actually sick, only to find out that everyone now has a different disease, and Mr. Krabs has a combination of all five diseases. The health inspector panics, yelling that everyone is sick, declaring an \"Ultra-Mega Quarantine.\" A team of Hazmat fish lock the Krusty Krab inside of a box and airlift it over to the Chum Bucket, where it is dropped.

When Pearl asks Plankton if she can help with Plankton's science experiments, he asks her if she can materialize a Krabby Patty.

When SpongeBob asks to ring the bell, Mr. Krabs offers him to ring the big bell from the roof. The bell's ring results in people all over Bikini Bottom drooling for Krabby Patties and heading towards the Krusty Krab.\nAs the customers are enjoying their Krabby Patties, Patrick suddenly bursts into the restaurant and throws a tantrum on the floors, causing the customers to leave. SpongeBob calms Patrick down by rubbing jelly on him. When asked what he recently remembers, Patrick gives a flashback to an experience he had as a kid, in which his parents ring a bell to get Patrick to take a bath. In the flashback, he cries out of not wanting one. After the flashback ends, SpongeBob proclaims that he will silence every bell in town, as he smashes through the Krusty Krab roof.\nMr. Krabs decides to use Patrick's tantrums to his advantage by encouraging him to participate in a fighting match against Harry the Health Hazard for $1 million.

SpongeBob is thrilled with the idea, but Mr. Krabs rejects the board game, causing Bubble Bass to run away. Squidward says Bubble Bass is gone because in his own words, they would never see that game geek again.

The two enter through the hatch and realize that there is a real version of the 3 Deadly Challenges (made of boxes). The first challenge begins: they both attack Bubble Bass and try to tap him out.

The boxes collapse and SpongeBob and Squidward fall, decapitating Bubble Bass, revealing that the Bubble Bass that Squidward tried to attack was not the real Bubble Bass, but a doll (made with Bubble Bass' mom's sofa cushions and sleeping bag).

They both go to the Duel Arena, find a box and a red scarf, and the box starts making strange noises (like a bull). Bubble Bass' mother comes out of the box and rages like a bull (because Bubble Bass told his mother that the furniture in the house was chipped by SpongeBob and Squidward), so the two try to hide behind the cloth, but Bubble Bass' mother still attacks them. In the middle of the fight, Mama Bass and Squidward begin to dance the tango, while SpongeBob is fond of it, but suddenly Mama Bass's clock rings and she tells Squidward that she has to go to a bake sale and to call her.

Squidward uses his spear and uses so much force that he thrusts it into Bubble Bass's bellybutton, defeating him.

The clients, angered by Bubble Bass, go directly to Mr. Krabs' office to pay him everything that Bubble Bass owes so that he can leave immediately. Mr. Krabs, already with the Bubble Bass account paid, goes to Bubble Bass, who was washing the dishes in the toilet, and tells him that his bill is already paid and that he can leave, Bubble Bass comes out of the bathroom happily. To Mr. Krabs' surprise and dismay, Bubble Bass does not leave, but instead orders a bunch more food and tells Mr. Krabs that he just opened a new account and goes on top of his cardboard horse, so Mr. Krabs furiously chases after Bubble Bass.
