While the output starts off readable (although lacking a lot of consistency), the output slowly devolves into more confusing nonsense. Part of this has to do with the limited ability of GPT3 to create large outputs for text completion. While I was optomistic that fine-tuning on large episode summaries could potnetially help to overcome this, it is evident that this is definetly not the case.\n",

Essentially, this is like using the fine-tuned model to get ball rolling on what to create the SpongeBob episode around, then using pre-existing models to finish up the job."

While helping Mr. Krabs open his safe with a crowbar, the crab tells SpongeBob that he needs to make sure no one borrows money from him during the next 24 hours. However, due to having spent most of his own funds on various things (including a kickback from Squidward's book rental), he can barely afford any food for himself for lunch.\n",

When Squidward objects and suggests that Patrick buys some hot dogs instead, the latter states he only has fifty cents and reveals that SpongeBob knows how to get that amount in less than twenty seconds in exchange for not telling anyone about this \"secret.\"\n",

After constructing several cardboard boomerangs from his paper towel roll, he goes out into the streets and finds that Sandy has already warned everyone about The Chum Monster. He finds Patrick raking leaves and convinces him to come with him on his adventure. However, Patrick only wants to know how many blades are in Squidward's box \"clip-clopping toward me.\" He then tells Patrick that he will tell him when they reach it and leaves while two fishing boats begin playing Annoying Annoying Song simultaneously once they are not paying attention.\n",

Squidward tries to throw a boomerang at it, but it just comes back and hits him in the face. The Chum Monster starts chasing them, and they run away until they run into a dead end.

This causes SpongeBob to argue with Squidward and run away crying.\n",

Afterwards, they decide to put on a show for Squidward as an apology for hurting his feelings while warning him of what they plan on doing (such as pulling knobs from their eyes and farting loudly) before assaulting him when he arrives at work the next morning.\n",

He tries to get the Krusty Krab back to its former state, but things only get worse. \n",

        "Ultimately, it's obvious that the second strategy of using smaller token sizes on each model call worked signficantly better than my original plan of generating an entire episode synopsis just from one use of the model. However, this is not to say that the results are flawless. The above examples show that, while the episode summaries generally read coherently, there are still many major issues in the plots that are developed that can leave you scratching your head on what is going on, as well as there being many awkwardly structured sentences that can be misunderstood at first. However, amidst all these issues, the generated episodes did show a good amount of creativity and interesting story telling at some parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is definetely noticeable from the above examples is that the specificty of the title helps a lot in keeping it alligned with the topic. The first example of \"Krabs Goes Broke\" generated an episode that very much focuses on this idea, whereas the last example of \"The New Zoo\" has practically very little with a zoo. Perhaps re-tuning the model to take a brief sentence summary of an episode rather than the title could lead to much better results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the idea of using a model to generate a cartoon episode could have implications in other uses of AI. For example, rather than generating SpongeBob episodes, one could perhaps fine-tune a model to give suggestions on what improvements a company should make to its product or what new and interesting coding projects one could pursue. While the output of my model wasn't perfect, it illustrates GTP3's ability to be creative and think of new ideas."
